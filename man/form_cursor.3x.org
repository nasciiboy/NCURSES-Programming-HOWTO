* NAME

  =pos_form_cursor= - position a form window cursor

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <form.h>
    int pos_form_cursor(FORM *form);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  The function =pos_form_cursor= restores the cursor to the position
  required for the forms driver to continue processing requests.  This
  is useful after =curses= routines have been called to do
  screen-painting in response to a form operation.

* RETURN VALUE

  This routine returns one of the following:

  * =E_OK=           :: The routine succeeded.

  * =E_BAD_ARGUMENT= :: Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range
                        argument.

  * =E_NOT_POSTED=   :: The form has not been posted.

  * =E_SYSTEM_ERROR= :: System error occurred (see =errno=).

* SEE ALSO

  [[file:ncurses.3x.org][curses(3x)]], [[file:form.3x.org][form(3x)]].

* NOTES

  The header file =<form.h>= automatically includes the header file
  =<curses.h>=.

* PORTABILITY

  These routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not
  supported on Version 7 or BSD versions.
