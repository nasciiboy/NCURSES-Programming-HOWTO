* NAME

  =mcprint= - ship binary data to printer

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <curses.h>

    int mcprint(char *data, int len);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  This function uses the =mc5p= or =mc4= and =mc5= capabilities, if
  they are present, to ship given data to a printer attached to the
  terminal.

  Note that the =mcprint= code has no way to do flow control with the
  printer or to know how much buffering it has.  Your application is
  responsible for keeping the rate of writes to the printer below its
  continuous throughput rate (typically about half of its nominal cps
  rating).  Dotmatrix printers and 6-page-per-minute lasers can
  typically handle 80cps, so a good conservative rule of thumb is to
  sleep for a second after shipping each 80-character line.

* RETURN VALUE

  The =mcprint= function returns =ERR= if the write operation aborted
  for some reason.  In this case, =errno= will contain either an error
  associated with =write(2)= or one of the following:

  - =ENODEV= :: Capabilities for printer redirection do not exist.

  - =ENOMEM= :: Couldn't allocate sufficient memory to buffer the
                printer write.


  When =mcprint= succeeds, it returns the number of characters
  actually sent to the printer.

* PORTABILITY

  The =mcprint= call was designed for [[file:ncurses.3x.org][ncurses(3x)]], and is not found in
  SVr4 curses, 4.4BSD curses, or any other previous version of curses.

* BUGS

  Padding in the =mc5p=, =mc4= and =mc5= capabilities will not be
  interpreted.
