* DESCRIPTION
** =baudrate=

   The =baudrate= routine returns the output speed of the terminal.
   The number returned is in bits per second, for example =9600=, and
   is an integer.

** =erasechar=, =erasewchar=

   The =erasechar= routine returns the user's current erase character.

   The =erasewchar= routine stores the current erase character in the
   location referenced by /ch/.  If no erase character has been
   defined, the routine fails and the location referenced by =ch= is
   not changed.

** =has_is=, =has_il=

   The =has_ic= routine is true if the terminal has insert- and
   delete- character capabilities.

   The =has_il= routine is true if the terminal has insert- and
   delete-line capabilities, or can simulate them using scrolling
   regions.  This might be used to determine if it would be
   appropriate to turn on physical scrolling using =scrollok=.

** =killchar=, =killwchar=

   The =killchar= routine returns the user's current line kill
   character.

   The =killwchar= routine stores the current line-kill character in
   the location referenced by /ch/.  If no line-kill character has
   been defined, the routine fails and the location referenced by =ch=
   is not changed.

** =longname=

   The =longname= routine returns a pointer to a static area
   containing a verbose description of the current terminal.  The
   maximum length of a verbose description is 128 characters.  It is
   defined only after the call to =initscr= or =newterm=.  The area is
   overwritten by each call to =newterm= and is not restored by
   =set_term=, so the value should be saved between calls to =newterm=
   if =longname= is going to be used with multiple terminals.

** =termattrs=, =term_attrs=

   If a given terminal does not support a video attribute that an
   application program is trying to use, =curses= may substitute a
   different video attribute for it.  The =termattrs= and =term_attrs=
   functions return a logical =OR= of all video attributes supported
   by the terminal using =A_= and =WA_= constants respectively.  This
   information is useful when a =curses= program needs complete
   control over the appearance of the screen.

** =termname=

   The =termname= routine returns the terminal name used by
   =setupterm=.

* RETURN VALUE

  =longname= and =termname= return =NULL= on error.

  Routines that return an integer return =ERR= upon failure and =OK=
  (SVr4 only specifies "an integer value other than =ERR=") upon
  successful completion.

* NOTES

  Note that =termattrs= may be a macro.

* PORTABILITY

  The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions.  It
  changes the return type of =termattrs= to the new type =attr_t=.
  Most versions of =curses= truncate the result returned by =termname=
  to 14 characters.
