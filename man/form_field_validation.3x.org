* DESCRIPTION

  The function =set_field_type= declares a data type for a given form
  field.  This is the type checked by validation functions.  The
  predefined types are as follows:

  - =TYPE_ALNUM= ::

    Alphanumeric data.  Requires a third =int= argument, a minimum
    field width.

  - =TYPE_ALPHA= ::

    Character data.  Requires a third =int= argument, a minimum field
    width.

  - =TYPE_ENUM= ::

    Accept one of a specified set of strings.  Requires a third (=char
    **=) argument pointing to a string list; a fourth =int= flag
    argument to enable case-sensitivity; and a fifth =int= flag
    argument specifying whether a partial match must be a unique one
    (if this flag is off, a prefix matches the first of any set of
    more than one list elements with that prefix). Please notice that
    the string list is copied. So you may use a list that lives in
    automatic variables on the stack.

  - =TYPE_INTEGER= ::

    Integer data, parsable to an integer by [[man:atoi][atoi(3)]].  Requires a third
    =int= argument controlling the precision, a fourth =long= argument
    constraining minimum value, and a fifth =long= constraining
    maximum value.  If the maximum value is less than or equal to the
    minimum value, the range is simply ignored. On return the field
    buffer is formatted according to the =printf= format specification
    ".*ld", where the '*' is replaced by the precision argument.  For
    details of the precision handling see [[man:printf][printf]]'s man-page.

  - =TYPE_NUMERIC= ::

    Numeric data (may have a decimal-point part).  Requires a third
    =int= argument controlling the precision, a fourth =double=
    argument constraining minimum value, and a fifth =double=
    constraining maximum value.  If your system supports locales, the
    decimal point character to be used must be the one specified by
    your locale.  If the maximum value is less than or equal to the
    minimum value, the range is simply ignored.  On return the field
    buffer is formatted according to the =printf= format specification
    ".*f", where the '*' is replaced by the precision argument.  For
    details of the precision handling see [[man:printf][printf]]'s man-page.

  - =TYPE_REGEXP= ::

    Regular expression data.  Requires a regular expression (=char *=)
    third argument; the data is valid if the regular expression
    matches it.  Regular expressions are in the format of =regcomp=
    and =regexec=.  Please notice that the regular expression must
    match the whole field. If you have for example an eight character
    wide field, a regular expression "=^[0-9]*$=" always means that
    you have to fill all eight positions with digits. If you want to
    allow fewer digits, you may use for example "=^[0-9]* *$=" which
    is good for trailing spaces (up to an empty field), or "=^ *[0-9]*
    *$=" which is good for leading and trailing spaces around the
    digits.

  - =TYPE_IPV4= ::

    An Internet Protocol Version 4 address. This requires no
    additional argument. It is checked whether or not the buffer has
    the form a.b.c.d, where a,b,c and d are numbers between 0
    and 255. Trailing blanks in the buffer are ignored. The address
    itself is not validated. Please note that this is an =ncurses=
    extension.  This field type may not be available in other =curses=
    implementations.


  It is possible to set up new programmer-defined field types.  See
  the [[file:form_fieldtype.3x.org][form_fieldtype(3x)]] manual page.

* RETURN VALUE

  The functions =field_type= and field_arg return =NULL= on error. The
  function =set_field_type= returns one of the following:

  - =E_OK=           :: The routine succeeded.

  - =E_SYSTEM_ERROR= :: System error occurred (see =errno=).

* NOTES

  The header file =<form.h>= automatically includes the header file
  =<curses.h>=.

* PORTABILITY

  These routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not
  supported on Version 7 or BSD versions.
