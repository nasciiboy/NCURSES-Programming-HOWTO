* NAME

  =inch=, =winch=, =mvinch=, =mvwinch= - get a character and
  attributes from a =curses= window

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <curses.h>

    chtype inch(void);
    chtype winch(WINDOW *win);
    chtype mvinch(int y, int x);
    chtype mvwinch(WINDOW *win, int y, int x);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  These routines return the character, of type =chtype=, at the
  current position in the named window.  If any attributes are set for
  that position, their values are OR'ed into the value returned.
  Constants defined in =<curses.h>= can be used with the =&= (logical
  AND) operator to extract the character or attributes alone.

** Attributes

   The following bit-masks may be AND-ed with characters returned by
   =winch=.

   - =A_CHARTEXT=   ::  Bit-mask to extract character

   - =A_ATTRIBUTES= ::  Bit-mask to extract attributes

   - =A_COLOR=      ::  Bit-mask to extract color-pair field
                        information

* RETURN VALUE

  Functions with a "mv" prefix first perform a cursor movement using
  =wmove=, and return an error if the position is outside the window,
  or if the window pointer is null.

* NOTES

  Note that all of these routines may be macros.

* PORTABILITY

  These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.
