* NAME

  =dynamic_field_info=, =form_field_info= - retrieve field
  characteristics

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <form.h>
    int field_info(const FIELD *field, int *rows, int *cols,
                  int *frow, int *fcol, int *nrow, int *nbuf);
    int  dynamic_field_info(const FIELD *field, int *rows,
                            int *cols, int *max);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  The function =field_info= returns the sizes and other attributes
  passed in to the field at its creation time.  The attributes are:
  height, width, row of upper-left corner, column of upper-left
  corner, number off-screen rows, and number of working buffers.

  The function =dynamic_field_info= returns the actual size of the
  field, and its maximum possible size.  If the field has no size
  limit, the location addressed by the third argument will be set
  to 0.  A field can be made dynamic by turning off the =O_STATIC=
  option with =field_opts_off= .

* RETURN VALUE

  These routines return one of the following:

  * =E_OK=           :: The routine succeeded.

  * =E_SYSTEM_ERROR= :: System error occurred (see =errno=).

  * =E_BAD_ARGUMENT= :: Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range
                        argument.

* SEE ALSO

  [[file:ncurses.3x.org][curses(3x)]] and related pages whose names begin "form_" for detailed
  descriptions of the entry points.

* NOTES

  The header file =<form.h>= automatically includes the header file
  =<curses.h>=.

* PORTABILITY

  These routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not
  supported on Version 7 or BSD versions.

  A null (zero pointer) is accepted for any of the return values, to
  ignore that value.  Not all implementations allow this, e.g.,
  Solaris 2.7 does not.
