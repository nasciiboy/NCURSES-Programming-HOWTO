* NAME

  =scanw=, =wscanw=, =mvscanw=, =mvwscanw=, =vwscanw=, =vw_scanw= -
  convert formatted input from a =curses= window

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <curses.h>

    int scanw(char *fmt, ...);
    int wscanw(WINDOW *win, char *fmt, ...);
    int mvscanw(int y, int x, char *fmt, ...);
    int mvwscanw(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, char *fmt, ...);
    int vw_scanw(WINDOW *win, char *fmt, va_list varglist);
    int vwscanw(WINDOW *win, char *fmt, va_list varglist);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  The =scanw=, =wscanw= and =mvscanw= routines are analogous to
  =scanf= [see [[man:scanf][scanf(3)]]].  The effect of these routines is as though
  =wgetstr= were called on the window, and the resulting line used as
  input for [[man:sscanf][sscanf(3)]].  Fields which do not map to a variable in the
  /fmt/ field are lost.

  The =vwscanw= and =vw_scanw= routines are analogous to =vscanf=.
  They perform a =wscanw= using a variable argument list.  The third
  argument is a va_list, a pointer to a list of arguments, as defined
  in =<stdarg.h>=.

* RETURN VALUE

  =vwscanw= returns =ERR= on failure and an integer equal to the
  number of fields scanned on success.

  Applications may use the return value from the =scanw=, =wscanw=,
  =mvscanw= and =mvwscanw= routines to determine the number of fields
  which were mapped in the call.

  Functions with a "mv" prefix first perform a cursor movement using
  =wmove=, and return an error if the position is outside the window,
  or if the window pointer is null.

* PORTABILITY

  The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions.  The
  function =vwscanw= is marked TO BE WITHDRAWN, and is to be replaced
  by a function =vw_scanw= using the =<stdarg.h>= interface.  The
  Single Unix Specification, Version 2 states that =vw_scanw= is
  preferred to =vwscanw= since the latter requires including
  =<varargs.h>=, which cannot be used in the same file as
  =<stdarg.h>=.  This implementation uses =<stdarg.h>= for both,
  because that header is included in =<curses.h>=.

  Both XSI and The Single Unix Specification, Version 2 state that
  these functions return =ERR= or =OK=.  Since the underlying =scanf=
  can return the number of items scanned, and the SVr4 code was
  documented to use this feature, this is probably an editing error
  which was introduced in XSI, rather than being done intentionally.
  Portable applications should only test if the return value is =ERR=,
  since the =OK= value (zero) is likely to be misleading.  One
  possible way to get useful results would be to use a "%n" conversion
  at the end of the format string to ensure that something was
  processed.
