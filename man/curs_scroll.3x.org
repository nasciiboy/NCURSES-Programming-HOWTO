* NAME

  =scroll=, =scrl=, =wscrl= - scroll a =curses= window

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <curses.h>

    int scroll(WINDOW *win);
    int scrl(int n);
    int wscrl(WINDOW *win, int n);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  The =scroll= routine scrolls the window up one line.  This involves
  moving the lines in the window data structure.  As an optimization,
  if the scrolling region of the window is the entire screen, the
  physical screen may be scrolled at the same time.

  For positive /n/, the =scrl= and =wscrl= routines scroll the window
  up /n/ lines (line /i+n/ becomes /i/); otherwise scroll the window
  down /n/ lines.  This involves moving the lines in the window
  character image structure.  The current cursor position is not
  changed.

  For these functions to work, scrolling must be enabled via
  =scrollok=.

* RETURN VALUE

  These routines return =ERR= upon failure, and =OK= (SVr4 only
  specifies "an integer value other than =ERR=") upon successful
  completion.

  X/Open defines no error conditions.

  This implementation returns an error if the window pointer is null,
  or if scrolling is not enabled in the window, e.g., with =scrollok=.

* NOTES

  Note that =scrl= and =scroll= may be macros.

  The SVr4 documentation says that the optimization of physically
  scrolling immediately if the scroll region is the entire screen "is"
  performed, not "may be" performed.  This implementation deliberately
  does not guarantee that this will occur, to leave open the
  possibility of smarter optimization of multiple scroll actions on
  the next update.

  Neither the SVr4 nor the XSI documentation specify whether the
  current attribute or current color-pair of blanks generated by the
  scroll function is zeroed.  Under this implementation it is.

* PORTABILITY

  The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions.
