* DESCRIPTION

** Reading characters

   The =getch=, =wgetch=, =mvgetch= and =mvwgetch=, routines read a
   character from the window.  In no-delay mode, if no input is
   waiting, the value =ERR= is returned.  In delay mode, the program
   waits until the system passes text through to the program.
   Depending on the setting of =cbreak=, this is after one character
   (cbreak mode), or after the first newline (nocbreak mode).  In
   half-delay mode, the program waits until a character is typed or
   the specified timeout has been reached.

   If =echo= is enabled, and the window is not a pad, then the
   character will also be echoed into the designated window according
   to the following rules:

   * If the character is the current erase character, left arrow, or
     backspace, the cursor is moved one space to the left and that
     screen position is erased as if =delch= had been called.

   * If the character value is any other =KEY_= define, the user is
     alerted with a =beep= call.

   * If the character is a carriage-return, and i wgetchf =nl= is
     enabled, it is translated to a line-feed after echoing.

   * Otherwise the character is simply output to the screen.


   If the window is not a pad, and it has been moved or modified since
   the last call to =wrefresh=, =wrefresh= will be called before
   another character is read.

** Keypad mode

   If =keypad= is =TRUE=, and a function key is pressed, the token for
   that function key is returned instead of the raw characters.
   Possible function keys are defined in =<curses.h>= as macros with
   values outside the range of 8-bit characters whose names begin with
   =KEY_=.  Thus, a variable intended to hold the return value of a
   function key must be of short size or larger.

   When a character that could be the beginning of a function key is
   received (which, on modern terminals, means an escape character),
   =curses= sets a timer.  If the remainder of the sequence does not
   come in within the designated time, the character is passed
   through; otherwise, the function key value is returned.  For this
   reason, many terminals experience a delay between the time a user
   presses the escape key and the escape is returned to the program.

** Ungetting characters

   The =ungetch= routine places =ch= back onto the input queue to be
   returned by the next call to =wgetch=.  There is just one input
   queue for all windows.

** Predefined key-codes

   The following special keys, defined in =<curses.h>=

   - Except for the special case =KEY_RESIZE=, it is necessary to
     enable =keypad= for =getch= to return these codes.

   - Not all of these are necessarily supported on any particular
     terminal.

   - The naming convention may seem obscure, with some ap- parent
     misspellings (such as "RSUME" for "resume").  The names
     correspond to the long terminfo capability names for the keys,
     and were defined long ago, in the 1980s.

   =keypad= is arranged like this:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     +-----+------+-------+
     | A1  |  up  |  A3   |
     +-----+------+-------+
     |left |  B2  | right |
     +-----+------+-------+
     | C1  | down |  C3   |
     +-----+------+-------+
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   A few of these predefined values do not correspond to a real key:

   * =KEY_RESIZE= is returned when the =SIGWINCH= signal has been
     detected (see [[file:curs_initscr.3x.org][curs_initscr(3x)]] and [[file:resizeterm.3x.org][resizeterm(3x)]]).

     This code is returned whether or not =keypad= has been enabled.

   * =KEY_MOUSE= is returned for mouse-events (see [[file:curs_mouse.3x.org][curs_mouse(3x)]]).
     This code relies upon whether or not [[file:curs_inopts.3x.org][keypad(3x)]] has been enabled,
     because (e.g., with xterm mouse prototocol) ncurses must read
     escape sequences, just like a function key.

** Testing key-codes

   The =has_key= routine takes a key-code value from the above list,
   and returns =TRUE= or =FALSE= according to whether the current
   terminal type recognizes a key with that value.

   The library also supports these extensions:

   - =define_key=  :: defines a key-code for a given string (see
                      [[file:define_key.3x.org][define_key(3x)]]).

   - =key_defined= :: checks if there is a key-code defined for a
                      given string (see [[file:key_defined.3x.org][key_defined(3x)]]).

* RETURN VALUE

  All routines return the integer =ERR= upon failure and an integer
  value other than =ERR= (=OK= in the case of =ungetch()=) upon
  successful completion.

  - =ungetch= :: returns =ERR= if there is no more room in the =FIFO=.

  - =wgetch=  :: returns =ERR= if the window pointer is null, or if
                 its timeout expires without having any data.


  Functions with a "mv" prefix first perform a cursor movement using
  =wmove=, and return an error if the position is outside the window,
  or if the window pointer is null.

* NOTES

  Use of the escape key by a programmer for a single character
  function is discouraged, as it will cause a delay of up to one
  second while the keypad code looks for a following function-key
  sequence.

  Some keys may be the same as commonly used control keys, e.g.,
  =KEY_ENTER= versus control/M, =KEY_BACKSPACE= versus control/H.
  Some =curses= implementations may differ according to whether they
  treat these control keys specially (and ignore the terminfo), or use
  the terminfo definitions.  =Ncurses= uses the terminfo definition.
  If it says that =KEY_ENTER= is control/M, =getch= will return
  =KEY_ENTER= when you press control/M.

  Generally, =KEY_ENTER= denotes the character(s) sent by the Enter
  key on the numeric keypad:

  * the terminal description lists the most useful keys,

  * the /Enter/ key on the regular keyboard is already handled by the
    standard ASCII characters for carriage-return and line-feed,

  * depending on whether =nl= or =nonl= was called, pressing "Enter"
    on the regular keyboard may return either a carriage-return or
    line-feed, and finally

  * "Enter or send" is the standard description for this key.


  When using =getch=, =wgetch=, =mvgetch=, or =mvwgetch=, nocbreak
  mode (=nocbreak=) and echo mode (=echo=) should not be used at the
  same time.  Depending on the state of the tty driver when each
  character is typed, the program may produce undesirable results.

  Note that =getch=, =mvgetch=, and =mvwgetch= may be macros.

  Historically, the set of keypad macros was largely defined by the
  extremely function-key-rich keyboard of the AT&T 7300, aka 3B1, aka
  Safari 4.  Modern personal computers usually have only a small
  subset of these.  IBM PC-style consoles typically support little
  more than =KEY_UP=, =KEY_DOWN=, =KEY_LEFT=, =KEY_RIGHT=, =KEY_HOME=,
  =KEY_END=, =KEY_NPAGE=, =KEY_PPAGE=, and function keys 1 through 12.
  The Ins key is usually mapped to =KEY_IC=.

* PORTABILITY

  The *get* functions are described in the XSI curses standard,
  Issue 4.  They read single-byte characters only.  The standard
  specifies that they return =ERR= on failure, but specifies no error
  conditions.

  The echo behavior of these functions on input of =KEY_= or backspace
  characters was not specified in the SVr4 documentation.  This
  description is adopted from the XSI Curses standard.

  The behavior of =getch= and friends in the presence of handled
  signals is unspecified in the SVr4 and XSI Curses documentation.
  Under historical =curses= implementations, it varied depending on
  whether the operating system's implementation of handled signal
  receipt interrupts a =read(2)= call in progress or not, and also (in
  some implementations) depending on whether an input timeout or
  nonblocking mode has been set.

  =KEY_MOUSE= is mentioned in XSI Curses, along with a few related
  terminfo capabilities, but no higher-level functions use the
  feature.  The implementation in ncurses is an extension.

  =KEY_RESIZE= is an extension first implemented for ncurses.  NetBSD
  curses later added this extension.

  Programmers concerned about portability should be prepared for
  either of two cases: (a) signal receipt does not interrupt =getch=;
  (b) signal receipt interrupts =getch= and causes it to return =ERR=
  with =errno= set to =EINTR=.  Under the =ncurses= implementation,
  handled signals never interrupt =getch=.

  The =has_key= function is unique to =ncurses=.  We recommend that
  any code using it be conditionalized on the =NCURSES_VERSION=
  feature macro.
