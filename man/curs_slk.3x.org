* DESCRIPTION

  The =slk*= functions manipulate the set of soft function-key labels
  that exist on many terminals.  For those terminals that do not have
  soft labels, =curses= takes over the bottom line of =stdscr=,
  reducing the size of =stdscr= and the variable =LINES=.  =curses=
  standardizes on eight labels of up to eight characters each.  In
  addition to this, the ncurses implementation supports a mode where
  it simulates 12 labels of up to five characters each.  This is
  useful for today's PC-like enduser devices.  =ncurses= simulates
  this mode by taking over up to two lines at the bottom of the
  screen; it does not try to use any hardware support for this mode.

  The =slk_init= routine must be called before =initscr= or =newterm=
  is called.  If =initscr= eventually uses a line from =stdscr= to
  emulate the soft labels, then /fmt/ determines how the labels are
  arranged on the screen:

  - 0 :: indicates a 3-2-3 arrangement of the labels.

  - 1 :: indicates a 4-4 arrangement

  - 2 :: indicates the PC-like 4-4-4 mode.

  - 3 :: is again the PC-like 4-4-4 mode, but in addition an index
         line is generated, helping the user to identify the key
         numbers easily.


  The =slk_set= routine (and the =slk_wset= routine for the
  wide-character library) has three parameters:

  - /labnum/ :: is the label number, from =1= to =8= (12 for /fmt/ in
                =slk_init= is =2= or =3=);

  - /label/  :: is be the string to put on the label, up to eight
                (five for /fmt/ in =slk_init= is =2= or =3=)
                characters in length.  A null string or a null pointer
                sets up a blank label.

  - /fmt/    :: is either =0=, =1=, or =2=, indicating whether the
                label is to be left-justified, centered, or
                right-justified, respectively, within the label.


  The =slk_refresh= and =slk_noutrefresh= routines correspond to the
  =wrefresh= and =wnoutrefresh= routines.

  The =slk_label= routine returns the current label for label number
  /labnum/, with leading and trailing blanks stripped.

  The =slk_clear= routine clears the soft labels from the screen.

  The =slk_restore= routine restores the soft labels to the screen
  after a =slk_clear= has been performed.

  The =slk_touch= routine forces all the soft labels to be output the
  next time a =slk_noutrefresh= is performed.

  The =slk_attron=, =slk_attrset=, =slk_attroff= and =slk_attr=
  routines correspond to =attron=, =attrset=, =attroff= and
  =attr_get=.  They have an effect only if soft labels are simulated
  on the bottom line of the screen.  The default highlight for soft
  keys is =A_STANDOUT= (as in System V =curses=, which does not
  document this fact).

  The =slk_color= routine corresponds to =color_set=.  It has an
  effect only if soft labels are simulated on the bottom line of the
  screen.

* RETURN VALUE

  These routines return =ERR= upon failure and =OK= (SVr4 specifies
  only "an integer value other than =ERR=") upon successful
  completion.

  X/Open defines no error conditions.  In this implementation

  - =slk_attr= ::

    returns the attribute used for the soft keys.

  - =slk_attroff=, =slk_attron=, =slk_clear=, =slk_noutrefresh=, =slk_refresh=, =slk_touch= ::

    return an error if the terminal or the softkeys were not
    initialized.

  - =slk_attrset= ::

    returns an error if the terminal or the softkeys were not
    initialized.

  - =slk_attr_set= ::

    returns an error if the terminal or the softkeys were not
    initialized, or the color pair is outside the range
    0..COLOR_PAIRS-1, or opts is not null.

  - =slk_color= ::

    returns an error if the terminal or the softkeys were not
    initialized, or the color pair is outside the range
    0..COLOR_PAIRS-1.

  - =slk_init= ::

    returns an error if the format parameter is outside the range
    0..3.

  - =slk_label= ::

    returns =NULL= on error.

  - =slk_set= ::

    returns an error if the terminal or the softkeys were not
    initialized, or the /labnum/ parameter is outside the range of
    label counts, or if the format parameter is outside the range
    0..2, or if memory for the labels cannot be allocated.

* NOTES

  Most applications would use =slk_noutrefresh= because a =wrefresh=
  is likely to follow soon.

* PORTABILITY

  The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4, describes these functions.  It
  changes the argument type of the attribute-manipulation functions
  =slk_attron=, =slk_attroff=, =slk_attrset= to be =attr_t=, and adds
  const qualifiers.  The format codes =2= and =3= for =slk_init()= and
  the function =slk_attr= are specific to ncurses.
