* NAME

  =new_field=, =dup_field=, =link_field=, =free_field= - create and
  destroy form fields

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <form.h>
    FIELD *new_field(int height, int width,
                     int toprow, int leftcol,
                     int offscreen, int nbuffers);
    FIELD *dup_field(FIELD *field, int toprow, int leftcol);
    FIELD *link_field(FIELD *field, int toprow, int leftcol);
    int free_field(FIELD *field);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  The function =new_field= allocates a new field and initializes it
  from the parameters given: height, width, row of upper-left corner,
  column of upper-left corner, number off-screen rows, and number of
  additional working buffers.

  The function =dup_field= duplicates a field at a new location.  Most
  attributes (including current contents, size, validation type,
  buffer count, growth threshold, justification, foreground,
  background, pad character, options, and user pointer) are copied.
  Field status and the field page bit are not copied.

  The function =link_field= acts like =dup_field=, but the new field
  shares buffers with its parent.  Attribute data is separate.

  The function =free_field= de-allocates storage associated with a
  field.

* RETURN VALUE

  The function, =new_field=, =dup_field=, =link_field= return =NULL=
  on error.  They set =errno= according to their success:

  * =E_OK=           :: The routine succeeded.

  * =E_BAD_ARGUMENT= :: Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range
                        argument.

  * =E_SYSTEM_ERROR= :: System error occurred, e.g., malloc failure.


  The function free_field returns one of the following:

  * =E_OK=           :: The routine succeeded.

  * =E_BAD_ARGUMENT= :: Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range
                        argument.

  * =E_CONNECTED=    :: field is connected.

* SEE ALSO

  [[file:ncurses.3x.org][curses(3x)]], [[file:form.3x.org][form(3x)]].

* NOTES

  The header file =<form.h>= automatically includes the header file
  =<curses.h>=.

* PORTABILITY

  These routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not
  supported on Version 7 or BSD versions.

  It may be unwise to count on the set of attributes copied by
  =dup_field= being portable; the System V forms library documents are
  not very explicit about what gets copied and what does not.
