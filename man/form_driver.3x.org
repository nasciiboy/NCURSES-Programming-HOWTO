* NAME

  =form_driver=, =form_driver_w= - command-processing loop of the form
  system

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <form.h>
    int form_driver(FORM *form, int c);
    int form_driver_w(FORM *form, int c, wchar_t wch);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION
** =form_driver=

   Once a form has been posted (displayed), you should funnel input
   events to it through =form_driver=.  This routine has three major
   input cases:

   * The input is a form navigation request.  Navigation request codes
     are constants defined in =<form.h>=, which are distinct from the
     key- and character codes returned by [[file:curs_getch.3x.org][wgetch(3x)]].

   * The input is a printable character.  Printable characters (which
     must be positive, less than 256) are checked according to the
     program's locale settings.

   * The input is the =KEY_MOUSE= special key associated with an mouse
     event.

** =form_driver_w=

   This extension simplifies the use of the forms library using wide
   characters.  The input is either a key code (a request) or a wide
   character returned by [[file:curs_get_wch.3x.org][get_wch(3x)]].  The type must be passed as
   well, to enable the library to determine whether the parameter is a
   wide character or a request.

** Form-driver requests

   The form driver requests are as follows:

   If the second argument is a printable character, the driver places
   it in the current position in the current field.  If it is one of
   the forms requests listed above, that request is executed.

** Mouse handling

   If the second argument is the =KEY_MOUSE= special key, the
   associated mouse event is translated into one of the above
   pre-defined requests.  Currently only clicks in the user window
   (e.g., inside the form display area or the decoration window) are
   handled.

   If you click above the display region of the form:

   * a =REQ_PREV_FIELD= is generated for a single click,

   * a =REQ_PREV_PAGE= is generated for a double-click and

   * a =REQ_FIRST_FIELD= is generated for a triple-click.


   If you click below the display region of the form:

   - a =REQ_NEXT_FIELD= is generated for a single click,

   - a =REQ_NEXT_PAGE= is generated for a double-click and

    - a =REQ_LAST_FIELD= is generated for a triple-click.


   If you click at an field inside the display area of the form:

   - the form cursor is positioned to that field.

   - If you double-click a field, the form cursor is positioned to
     that field and =E_UNKNOWN_COMMAND= is returned.  This return
     value makes sense, because a double click usually means that an
     field-specific action should be returned.  It is exactly the
     purpose of this return value to signal that an application
     specific command should be executed.

   - If a translation into a request was done, =form_driver= returns
     the result of this request.


   If you clicked outside the user window or the mouse event could not
   be translated into a form request an =E_REQUEST_DENIED= is
   returned.

** Application-defined commands

   If the second argument is neither printable nor one of the above
   pre-defined form requests, the driver assumes it is an
   application-specific command and returns =E_UNKNOWN_COMMAND=.
   Application-defined commands should be defined relative to
   =MAX_COMMAND=, the maximum value of these predefined requests.

* RETURN VALUE

  - =form_driver=       :: returns one of the following error codes:

  - =E_OK=              :: The routine succeeded.

  - =E_BAD_ARGUMENT=    :: Routine detected an incorrect or
                           out-of-range argument.

  - =E_BAD_STATE=       :: Routine was called from an initialization
                           or termination function.

  - =E_NOT_POSTED=      :: The form has not been posted.

  - =E_INVALID_FIELD=   :: Contents of field is invalid.

  - =E_REQUEST_DENIED=  :: The form driver could not process the
                           request.

  - =E_SYSTEM_ERROR=    :: System error occurred (see =errno=).

  - =E_UNKNOWN_COMMAND= :: The form driver code saw an unknown request
                           code.
