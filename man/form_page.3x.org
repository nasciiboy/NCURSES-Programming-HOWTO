* NAME

  =form_page= - set and get form page number

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <form.h>
    int set_current_field(FORM *form, FIELD *field);
    FIELD *current_field(const FORM *);
    int set_form_page(FORM *form, int n);
    int form_page(const FORM *form);
    int field_index(const FIELD *field);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  The function =set_current= field sets the current field of the given
  form; =current_field= returns the current field of the given form.

  The function =set_form_page= sets the form's page number (goes to
  page /n/ of the form).

  The function =form_page= returns the form's current page number.

  The function =field_index= returns the index of the field in the
  field array of the form it is connected to. It returns =ERR= if the
  argument is the null pointer or the field is not connected.

* RETURN VALUE

  Except for =form_page=, each routine returns one of the following:

  - =E_OK=             :: The routine succeeded.

  - =E_BAD_ARGUMENT=   :: Routine detected an incorrect or
                          out-of-range argument.

  - =E_BAD_STATE=      :: Routine was called from an initialization or
                          termination function.

  - =E_INVALID_FIELD=  :: Contents of a field are not valid.

  - =E_REQUEST_DENIED= :: The form driver could not process the
                          request.

  - =E_SYSTEM_ERROR=   :: System error occurred (see =errno=).
