* NAME

  =border=, =wborder=, =box=, =hline=, =whline=, =vline=, =wvline=,
  =mvhline=, =mvwhline=, =mvvline=, =mvwvline= - create =curses=
  borders, horizontal and vertical lines

* DESCRIPTION

  The =border=, =wborder= and =box= routines draw a box around the
  edges of a window.  Other than the window, each argument is a
  character with attributes:

  * =ls= - left side,
  * =rs= - right side,
  * =ts= - top side,
  * =bs= - bottom side,
  * =tl= - top left-hand corner,
  * =tr= - top right-hand corner,
  * =bl= - bottom left-hand corner, and
  * =br= - bottom right-hand corner.

  If any of these arguments is zero, then the corresponding default
  values (defined in =curses.h=) are used instead:

  * =ACS_VLINE=,
  * =ACS_VLINE=,
  * =ACS_HLINE=,
  * =ACS_HLINE=,
  * =ACS_ULCORNER=,
  * =ACS_URCORNER=,
  * =ACS_LLCORNER=,
  * =ACS_LRCORNER=.

  =box(win, verch, horch)= is a shorthand for the following call:
  =wborder(win, verch, verch, horch, horch, 0, 0, 0, 0)=.

  The =hline= and =whline= functions draw a horizontal (left to right)
  line using =ch= starting at the current cursor position in the
  window.  The current cursor position is not changed.  The line is at
  most /n/ characters long, or as many as fit into the window.

  The =vline= and =wvline= functions draw a vertical (top to bottom)
  line using =ch= starting at the current cursor position in the
  window.  The current cursor position is not changed.  The line is at
  most /n/ characters long, or as many as fit into the window.

* RETURN VALUE

  All routines return the integer =OK=.  The SVr4.0 manual says "or a
  non-negative integer if =immedok= is set", but this appears to be an
  error.

  X/Open does not define any error conditions.  This implementation
  returns an error if the window pointer is null.

  Functions with a "mv" prefix first perform a cursor movement using
  =wmove=, and return an error if the position is outside the window,
  or if the window pointer is null.

* NOTES

  The borders generated by these functions are inside borders (this is
  also true of SVr4 =curses=, though the fact is not documented).

  Note that =border= and =box= may be macros.

* PORTABILITY

  These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.
  The standard specifies that they return =ERR= on failure, but
  specifies no error conditions.
