* NAME

  =set_field_userptr=, =field_userptr= - associate application data
  with a form field

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <form.h>
    int set_field_userptr(FIELD *field, void*userptr);
    void *field_userptr(const FIELD *field);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  Every form field has a field that can be used to hold
  application-specific data (that is, the form-driver code leaves it
  alone).  These functions get and set that field.

* RETURN VALUE

  The function =field_userptr= returns a pointer (which may be
  =NULL=).  It does not set =errno=.

  The function =set_field_userptr= returns =E_OK= (success).

* SEE ALSO

  [[file:ncurses.3x.org][curses(3x)]], [[file:form.3x.org][form(3x)]].

* NOTES

  The header file =<form.h>= automatically includes the header file
  =<curses.h>=.

* PORTABILITY

  These routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not
  supported on Version 7 or BSD versions.

  The user pointer is a void pointer.  We chose not to leave it as a
  char pointer for SVr4 compatibility.
