* NAME

  =use_legacy_coding= - use terminal's default colors

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <curses.h>

    int use_legacy_coding(int level);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  The =use_legacy_coding()= function is an extension to the curses
  library.  It allows the caller to change the result of =unctrl=, and
  suppress related checks within the library that would normally cause
  nonprinting characters to be rendered in visible form.  This affects
  only 8-bit characters.

  The level parameter controls the result:

  - 0 ::

    the library functions normally, rendering nonprinting characters
    as described in =unctrl=.

  - 1 ::

    the library ignores =isprintf= for codes in the range 160-255.

  - 2 ::

    the library ignores =isprintf= for codes in the range 128-255.  It
    also modifies the output of =unctrl=, showing codes in the range
    128-159 as is.

* RETURN VALUE

  If the screen has not been initialized, or the level parameter is
  out of range, the function returns =ERR=.  Otherwise, it returns the
  previous level: =0=, =1= or =2=.

* PORTABILITY

  This routine is specific to ncurses.  It was not supported on
  Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.  It is recommended that
  any code depending on =ncurses= extensions be conditioned using
  =NCURSES_VERSION=.
