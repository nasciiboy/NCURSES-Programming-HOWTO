* NAME

  =menu_win= - make and break menu window and subwindow associations

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <menu.h>
    int set_menu_win(MENU *menu, WINDOW *win);
    WINDOW *menu_win(const MENU *menu);
    int set_menu_sub(MENU *menu, WINDOW *sub);
    WINDOW *menu_sub(const MENU *menu);
    int scale_menu(const MENU *menu, int *rows, int *columns);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  Every menu has an associated pair of =curses= windows.  The menu
  window displays any title and border associated with the window; the
  menu subwindow displays the items of the menu that are currently
  available for selection.

  The first four functions get and set those windows.  It is not
  necessary to set either window; by default, the driver code uses
  =stdscr= for both.

  In the =set_= functions, window argument of =NULL= is treated as
  though it were =stsdcr=.  A menu argument of =NULL= is treated as a
  request to change the system default menu window or subwindow.

  The function =scale_menu= returns the minimum size required for the
  subwindow of /menu/.

* RETURN VALUE

  Routines that return pointers return =NULL= on error.  Routines that
  return an integer return one of the following error codes:

  - =E_OK=            :: The routine succeeded.

  - =E_SYSTEM_ERROR=  :: System error occurred (see =errno=).

  - =E_BAD_ARGUMENT=  :: Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range
                         argument.

  - =E_POSTED=        :: The menu has already been posted.

  - =E_NOT_CONNECTED= :: No items are connected to the menu.

* NOTES

  The header file =<menu.h>= automatically includes the header file
  =<curses.h>=.

* PORTABILITY

  These routines emulate the System V menu library.  They were not
  supported on Version 7 or BSD versions.
