* NAME

  =use_default_colors=, =assume_default_colors= - use terminal's
  default colors

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <curses.h>

    int use_default_colors(void);
    int assume_default_colors(int fg, int bg);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  The =use_default_colors()= and =assume_default_colors()= functions
  are extensions to the =curses= library.  They are used with
  terminals that support ISO 6429 color, or equivalent.  These
  terminals allow the application to reset color to an unspecified
  default value (e.g., with SGR 39 or SGR 49).

  Applications that paint a colored background over the whole screen
  do not take advantage of SGR 39 and SGR 49.  Some applications are
  designed to work with the default background, using colors only for
  text.  For example, there are several implementations of the =ls=
  program which use colors to denote different file types or
  permissions.  These "color ls" programs do not necessarily modify
  the background color, typically using only the setaf =terminfo=
  capability to set the foreground color.  Full-screen applications
  that use default colors can achieve similar visual effects.

  The first function, =use_default_colors()= tells the =curses=
  library to assign terminal default foreground/background colors to
  color number -1.  So =init_pair(x,COLOR_RED,-1)= will initialize
  pair x as red on default background and =init_pair(x,-1,COLOR_BLUE)=
  will initialize pair x as default foreground on blue.

  The other, =assume_default_colors()= is a refinement which tells
  which colors to paint for color pair 0.  This function recognizes a
  special color number =-1=, which denotes the default terminal color.

  The following are equivalent:

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    use_default_colors();
    assume_default_colors(-1,-1);
  #+END_SRC

  These are =ncurses= extensions.  For other =curses= implementations,
  color number -1 does not mean anything, just as for ncurses before a
  successful call of =use_default_colors()= or
  =assume_default_colors()=.

  Other curses implementations do not allow an application to modify
  color pair 0.  They assume that the background is =COLOR_BLACK=, but
  do not ensure that the color pair 0 is painted to match the
  assumption.  If your application does not use either
  =use_default_colors()= or =assume_default_colors()= ncurses will
  paint a white foreground (text) with black background for color
  pair 0.

* RETURN VALUE

  These functions return the integer =ERR= upon failure and =OK= on
  success.  They will fail if either the terminal does not support the
  =orig_pair= or =orig_colors= capability.  If the =initialize_pair=
  capability is not found, this causes an error as well.

* NOTES

  Associated with this extension, the =init_pair= function accepts
  negative arguments to specify default foreground or background
  colors.

  The =use_default_colors()= function was added to support ded.  This
  is a full-screen application which uses =curses= to manage only part
  of the screen.  The bottom portion of the screen, which is of
  adjustable size, is left uncolored to display the results from shell
  commands.  The top portion of the screen colors filenames using a
  scheme like the "color ls" programs.  Attempting to manage the
  background color of the screen for this application would give
  unsatisfactory results for a variety of reasons.  This extension was
  devised after noting that color xterm (and similar programs)
  provides a background color which does not necessarily correspond to
  any of the ANSI colors.  While a special =terminfo= entry could be
  constructed using nine colors, there was no mechanism provided
  within =curses= to account for the related =orig_pair= and
  =back_color_erase= capabilities.

  The =assume_default_colors()= function was added to solve a
  different problem: support for applications which would use
  environment variables and other configuration to bypass =curses='
  notion of the terminal's default colors, setting specific values.

* PORTABILITY

  These routines are specific to ncurses.  They were not supported on
  Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.  It is recommended that
  any code depending on them be conditioned using =NCURSES_VERSION=.
