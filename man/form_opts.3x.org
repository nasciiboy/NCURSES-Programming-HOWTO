* NAME

  =set_form_opts=, =form_opts_on=, =form_opts_off=, =form_opts= - set
  and get form options

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <form.h>
    int set_form_opts(FORM *form, Field_Options opts);
    int form_opts_on(FORM *form, Field_Options opts);
    int form_opts_off(FORM *form, Field_Options opts);
    Field_Options form_opts(const FORM *form);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  The function =set_form_opts= sets all the given form's option bits
  (form option bits may be logically-OR'ed together).

  The function =form_opts_on= turns on the given option bits, and
  leaves others alone.

  The function =form_opts_off= turns off the given option bits, and
  leaves others alone.

  The function =form_opts= returns the form's current option bits.

  The following options are defined (all are on by default):

  - =O_NL_OVERLOAD= ::

    Overload the =REQ_NEW_LINE= forms driver request so that calling
    it at the end of a field goes to the next field.

  - =O_BS_OVERLOAD= ::

    Overload the =REQ_DEL_PREV= forms driver request so that calling
    it at the beginning of a field goes to the previous field.

* RETURN VALUE

  Except for =form_opts=, each routine returns one of the following:

  - =E_OK=           :: The routine succeeded.

  - =E_SYSTEM_ERROR= :: System error occurred (see =errno=).

* SEE ALSO

* NOTES

  The header file =<form.h>= automatically includes the header file
  =<curses.h>=.

* PORTABILITY

  These routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not
  supported on Version 7 or BSD versions.
