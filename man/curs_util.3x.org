* DESCRIPTION

** =unctrl=

   The =unctrl= routine returns a character string which is a
   printable representation of the character c, ignoring attributes.
   Control characters are displayed in the =^X= notation.  Printing
   characters are displayed as is.  The corresponding =wunctrl=
   returns a printable representation of a wide character.

** =keyname/=key_name=

   The =keyname= routine returns a character string corresponding to
   the key c:

   * Printable characters are displayed as themselves, e.g., a
     one-character string containing the key.

   * Control characters are displayed in the =^X= notation.

   * DEL (character 127) is displayed as =^?=.

   * Values above 128 are either meta characters (if the screen has
     not been initialized, or if =meta= has been called with a =TRUE=
     parameter), shown in the =M=-X notation, or are displayed as
     themselves.  In the latter case, the values may not be printable;
     this follows the X/Open specification.

   * Values above 256 may be the names of the names of function keys.

   * Otherwise (if there is no corresponding name) the function
     returns null, to denote an error.  X/Open also lists an "UNKNOWN
     KEY" return value, which some implementations return rather than
     null.


   The corresponding =key_name= returns a character string
   corresponding to the wide-character value w.  The two functions do
   not return the same set of strings; the latter returns null where
   the former would display a meta character.

** =filter/nofilter=

   The =filter= routine, if used, must be called before =initscr= or
   =newterm= are called.  The effect is that, during those calls,
   =LINES= is set to 1; the capabilities =clear=, =cup=, =cud=,
   =cud1=, =cuu1=, =cuu=, =vpa= are disabled; and the =home= string is
   set to the value of =cr=.

   The =nofilter= routine cancels the effect of a preceding =filter=
   call.  That allows the caller to initialize a screen on a different
   device, using a different value of =$TERM=.  The limitation arises
   because the filter routine modifies the in-memory copy of the
   terminal information.

** =use_env=

   The =use_env= routine, if used, should be called before =initscr=
   or =newterm= are called (because those compute the screen size).
   It modifies the way =ncurses= treats environment variables when
   determining the screen size.

   * Normally ncurses looks first at the terminal database for the
     screen size.

     If =use_env= was called with =FALSE= for parameter, it stops here
     unless If =use_tioctl= was also called with =TRUE= for parameter.

   * Then it asks for the screen size via operating system calls.  If
     successful, it overrides the values from the terminal database.

   * Finally (unless =use_env= was called with =FALSE= parameter),
     ncurses examines the =LINES= or =COLUMNS= environment variables,
     using a value in those to override the results from the operating
     system or terminal database.

     =ncurses= also updates the screen size in response to =SIGWINCH=,
     unless overridden by the =LINES= or =COLUMNS= environment
     variables,

** =use_tioctl=

   The =use_tioctl= routine, if used, should be called before
   =initscr= or =newterm= are called (because those compute the screen
   size).  After =use_tioctl= is called with =TRUE= as an argument,
   ncurses modifies the last step in its computation of screen size as
   follows:

   * checks if the =LINES= and =COLUMNS= environment variables are set
     to a number greater than zero.

   * for each, ncurses updates the corresponding environment variable
     with the value that it has obtained via operating system call or
     from the terminal database.

   * ncurses re-fetches the value of the environment variables so that
     it is still the environment variables which set the screen size.


   The =use_env= and =use_tioctl= routines combine as summarized here:

   | =use_env= | =use_tioctl= | Summary                                               |
   |---------+------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
   | ~TRUE~  | ~FALSE~    | This  is  the default behavior.  ~ncurses~ uses       |
   |         |            | operating system calls unless overridden by           |
   |         |            | $LINES or $COLUMNS environmentvariables.              |
   |---------+------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
   | ~TRUE~  | ~TRUE~     | ~ncurses~  updates  $LINES  and   $COLUMNS            |
   |         |            | based on operating system calls.                      |
   |---------+------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
   | ~FALSE~ | ~TRUE~     | ~ncurses~ ignores $LINES and $COLUMNS, uses operating |
   |         |            | system  calls  to  obtain size.                       |
   |---------+------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
   | ~FALSE~ | ~FALSE~    | ~ncurses~  relies on the terminal database            |
   |         |            | to determine size.                                    |
   |---------+------------+-------------------------------------------------------|

** =putwin/getwin=

   The =putwin= routine writes all data associated with window (or
   pad) /win/ into the file to which filep points.  This information
   can be later retrieved using the =getwin= function.

   The =getwin= routine reads window related data stored in the file
   by =putwin=.  The routine then creates and initializes a new window
   using that data.  It returns a pointer to the new window.  There
   are a few caveats:

   * the data written is a copy of the =WINDOW= structure, and its
     associated character cells.  The format differs between the
     wide-character (ncursesw) and nonwide (ncurses) libraries.  You
     can transfer data between the two, however.

   * the retrieved window is always created as a top-level window (or
     pad), rather than a subwindow.

   * the window's character cells contain the color pair value, but
     not the actual color numbers.  If cells in the retrieved window
     use color pairs which have not been created in the application
     using =init_pair=, they will not be colored when the window is
     refreshed.

** =delay_output=

   The =delay_output= routine inserts an ms millisecond pause in
   output.  This routine should not be used extensively because
   padding characters are used rather than a CPU pause.  If no padding
   character is specified, this uses =napms= to perform the delay.

** =flushinp=

   The =flushinp= routine throws away any typeahead that has been
   typed by the user and has not yet been read by the program.

* RETURN VALUE

  Except for =flushinp=, routines that return an integer return =ERR=
  upon failure and =OK= (SVr4 specifies only "an integer value other
  than =ERR=") upon successful completion.

  Routines that return pointers return =NULL= on error.

  X/Open does not define any error conditions.  In this implementation

  * =flushinp= :: returns an error if the terminal was not
                  initialized.

  * =meta=     :: returns an error if the terminal was not
                  initialized.

  * =putwin=   :: returns an error if the associated =fwrite= calls
                  return an error.

* PORTABILITY
** =filter=

   The SVr4 documentation describes the action of =filter= only in the
   vaguest terms.  The description here is adapted from the XSI Curses
   standard (which erroneously fails to describe the disabling of
   =cuu=).

** =keyname=

   The =keyname= function may return the names of user-defined string
   capabilities which are defined in the =terminfo= entry via the =-x=
   option of =tic=.  This implementation automatically assigns at
   run-time keycodes to user-defined strings which begin with "k".
   The keycodes start at =KEY_MAX=, but are not guaranteed to be the
   same value for different runs because user-defined codes are merged
   from all terminal descriptions which have been loaded.  The
   =use_extended_names= function controls whether this data is loaded
   when the terminal description is read by the library.

** =nofilter/use_tioctl=

   The =nofilter= and =use_tioctl= routines are specific to ncurses.
   They were not supported on Version 7, BSD or System V
   implementations.  It is recommended that any code depending on
   ncurses extensions be conditioned using =NCURSES_VERSION=.

** =putwin/getwin=

   The =putwin= and =getwin= functions have several issues with
   portability:

   * The files written and read by these functions use an
     implementation-specific format.  Although the format is an
     obvious target for standardization, it has been overlooked.

     Interestingly enough, according to the copyright dates in Solaris
     source, the functions (along with =scr_init=, etc.) originated
     with the University of California, Berkeley (in 1982) and were
     later (in 1988) incorporated into SVr4.  Oddly, there are no such
     functions in the 4.3 BSD curses sources.

   * Most implementations simply dump the binary =WINDOW= structure to
     the file.  These include SVr4 =curses=, NetBSD and PDCurses, as
     well as older =ncurses= versions.  This implementation (as well
     as the X/Open variant of Solaris =curses=, dated 1995) uses
     textual dumps.

     The implementations which use binary dumps use block-I/O (the
     =fwrite= and =fread= functions).  Those that use textual dumps
     use buffered-I/O.  A few applications may happen to write extra
     data in the file using these functions.  Doing that can run into
     problems mixing block- and buffered-I/O.  This implementation
     reduces the problem on writes by flushing the output.  However,
     reading from a file written using mixed schemes may not be
     successful.

** =unctrl/wunctrl=

   The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions.  It
   states that =unctrl= and =wunctrl= will return a null pointer if
   unsuccessful, but does not define any error conditions.  This
   implementation checks for three cases:

   * the parameter is a 7-bit US-ASCII code.  This is the case that
     X/Open Curses documented.

   * the parameter is in the range 128-159, i.e., a C1 control code.
     If =use_legacy_coding= has been called with a 2 parameter,
     =unctrl= returns the parameter, i.e., a one-character string with
     the parameter as the first character.  Otherwise, it returns
     "~@", "~A", etc., analogous to "^@", "^A", C0 controls.

     X/Open Curses does not document whether =unctrl= can be called
     before initializing curses.  This implementation permits that,
     and returns the "~@", etc., values in that case.

   * parameter values outside the 0 to 255 range.  =unctrl= returns a
     null pointer.


   The strings returned by =unctrl= in this implementation are
   determined at compile time, showing C1 controls from the upper-128
   codes with a `~' prefix rather than `^'.  Other implementations
   have different conventions.  For example, they may show both sets
   of control characters with `^', and strip the parameter to 7 bits.
   Or they may ignore C1 controls and treat all of the upper-128 codes
   as printable.  This implementation uses 8 bits but does not modify
   the string to reflect locale.  The =use_legacy_coding= function
   allows the caller to change the output of =unctrl=.

   Likewise, the =meta= function allows the caller to change the
   output of =keyname=, i.e., it determines whether to use the `M-'
   prefix for "meta" keys (codes in the range 128 to 255).  Both
   =use_legacy_coding= and =meta= succeed only after curses is
   initialized.  X/Open Curses does not document the treatment of
   codes 128 to 159.  When treating them as "meta" keys (or if
   =keyname= is called before initializing curses), this
   implementation returns strings "M-^@", "M-^A", etc.
