* NAME

  =post_menu=, =unpost_menu= - write or erase menus from associated
  subwindows

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <menu.h>
    int post_menu(MENU *menu);
    int unpost_menu(MENU *menu);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  The function =post_menu= displays a menu to its associated
  subwindow.  To trigger physical display of the subwindow, use
  =refresh= or some equivalent =curses= routine (the implicit
  =doupdate= triggered by an =curses= input request will
  do). post_menu resets the selection status of all items.

  The function =unpost_menu= erases menu from its associated
  subwindow.

* RETURN VALUE

  These routines return one of the following:

  - =E_OK=            :: The routine succeeded.

  - =E_SYSTEM_ERROR=  :: System error occurred (see =errno=).

  - =E_BAD_ARGUMENT=  :: Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range
                         argument.

  - =E_POSTED=        :: The menu has already been posted.

  - =E_BAD_STATE=     :: Routine was called from an initialization or
                         termination function.

  - =E_NO_ROOM=       :: Menu is too large for its window. You should
                         consider to use =set_menu_format()= to solve
                         the problem.

  - =E_NOT_POSTED=    :: The menu has not been posted.

  - =E_NOT_CONNECTED= :: No items are connected to the menu.
