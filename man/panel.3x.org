* DESCRIPTION

  Panels are [[file:ncurses.3x.org][curses(3x)]] windows with the added feature of depth.
  Panel functions allow the use of stacked windows and ensure the
  proper portions of each window and the curses =stdscr= window are
  hidden or displayed when panels are added, moved, modified or
  removed.  The set of currently visible panels is the stack of
  panels.  The =stdscr= window is beneath all panels, and is not
  considered part of the stack.

  A window is associated with every panel.  The panel routines enable
  you to create, move, hide, and show panels, as well as position a
  panel at any desired location in the stack.

  Panel routines are a functional layer added to [[file:ncurses.3x.org][curses(3x)]], make only
  high-level =curses= calls, and work anywhere terminfo =curses= does.

* FUNCTIONS

  * =new_panel(win)= ::

    allocates a =PANEL= structure, associates it with /win/, places
    the panel on the top of the stack (causes it to be displayed above
    any other panel) and returns a pointer to the new panel.

  * =update_panels()= ::

    refreshes the virtual screen to reflect the relations between the
    panels in the stack, but does not call =doupdate()= to refresh the
    physical screen.  Use this function and not =wrefresh= or
    =wnoutrefresh=.  =update_panels= may be called more than once
    before a call to =doupdate()=, but =doupdate()= is the function
    responsible for updating the physical screen.

  * =del_panel(pan)= ::

    removes the given panel from the stack and deallocates the =PANEL=
    structure (but not its associated window).

  * =hide_panel(pan)= ::

    removes the given panel from the panel stack and thus hides it
    from view. The =PANEL= structure is not lost, merely removed from
    the stack.

  * =panel_hidden(pan)= ::

    returns =TRUE= if the panel is in the panel stack, =FALSE= if it
    is not.  If the panel is a null pointer, return =ERR=.

  * =show_panel(pan)= ::

    makes a hidden panel visible by placing it on top of the panels in
    the panel stack. See *COMPATIBILITY* below.

  * =top_panel(pan)= ::

    puts the given visible panel on top of all panels in the stack.
    See *COMPATIBILITY* below.

  * =bottom_panel(pan)= ::

    puts panel at the bottom of all panels.

  * =move_panel(pan,starty,startx)= ::

    moves the given panel window so that its upper-left corner is at
    =starty=, =startx=.  It does not change the position of the panel
    in the stack.  Be sure to use this function, not =mvwin()=, to
    move a panel window.

  * =replace_panel(pan,window)= ::

    replaces the current window of panel with =window= (useful, for
    example if you want to resize a panel; if you're using =ncurses=,
    you can call =replace_panel= on the output of [[file:wresize.3x.org][wresize(3x)]]).  It
    does not change the position of the panel in the stack.

  * =panel_above(pan)= ::

    returns a pointer to the panel above pan.  If the panel argument
    is =(PANEL *)0=, it returns a pointer to the bottom panel in the
    stack.

  * =panel_below(pan)= ::

    returns a pointer to the panel just below pan.  If the panel
    argument is (PANEL *)0, it returns a pointer to the top panel in
    the stack.

  * =set_panel_userptr(pan,ptr)= ::

    sets the panel's user pointer.

  * =panel_userptr(pan)= ::

    returns the user pointer for a given panel.

  * =panel_window(pan)= ::

    returns a pointer to the window of the given panel.

* DIAGNOSTICS

  Each routine that returns a pointer returns =NULL= if an error
  occurs. Each routine that returns an int value returns =OK= if it
  executes successfully and =ERR= if not.

* COMPATIBILITY

  Reasonable care has been taken to ensure compatibility with the
  native panel facility introduced in SVr3.2 (inspection of the SVr4
  manual pages suggests the programming interface is unchanged).  The
  =PANEL= data structures are merely similar. The programmer is
  cautioned not to directly use =PANEL= fields.

  The functions =show_panel()= and =top_panel()= are identical in this
  implementation, and work equally well with displayed or hidden
  panels.  In the native System V implementation, =show_panel()= is
  intended for making a hidden panel visible (at the top of the stack)
  and =top_panel()= is intended for making an already-visible panel
  move to the top of the stack. You are cautioned to use the correct
  function to ensure compatibility with native panel libraries.

* NOTE

  In your library list, libpanel.a should be before libncurses.a; that
  is, you want to say '-lpanel -lncurses', not the other way around
  (which would usually give a linkerror).

* FILES

  =panel.h= interface for the panels library

  =libpanel.a= the panels library itself
