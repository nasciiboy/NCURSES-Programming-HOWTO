* NAME

  =form_hook= - set hooks for automatic invocation by applications

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <form.h>
    int set_field_init(FORM *form, Form_Hook func);
    Form_Hook field_init(const FORM *form);
    int set_field_term(FORM *form, Form_Hook func);
    Form_Hook field_term(const FORM *form);
    int set_form_init(FORM *form, Form_Hook func);
    Form_Hook form_init(const FORM *form);
    int set_form_term(FORM *form, Form_Hook func);
    Form_Hook form_term(const FORM *form);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  These functions make it possible to set hook functions to be called
  at various points in the automatic processing of input event codes
  by =form_driver=.

  The function =set_field_init= sets a hook to be called at form-post
  time and each time the selected field changes (after the change).
  =field_init= returns the current field =init= hook, if any (=NULL=
  if there is no such hook).

  The function =set_field_term= sets a hook to be called at
  form-unpost time and each time the selected field changes (before
  the change).  =field_term= returns the current field term hook, if
  any (=NULL= if there is no such hook).

  The function =set_form_init= sets a hook to be called at form-post
  time and just after a page change once it is posted.  =form_init=
  returns the current form init hook, if any (=NULL= if there is no
  such hook).

  The function =set_form_term= sets a hook to be called at form-unpost
  time and just before a page change once it is posted.  =form_init=
  returns the current form term hook, if any (=NULL= if there is no
  such hook).

* RETURN VALUE

  Routines that return pointers return =NULL= on error.  Other
  routines return one of the following:

  - =E_OK=           :: The routine succeeded.

  - =E_SYSTEM_ERROR= :: System error occurred (see =errno=).

* NOTES

  The header file =<form.h>= automatically includes the header file
  =<curses.h>=.

* PORTABILITY

  These routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not
  supported on Version 7 or BSD versions.
