* NAME

  =new_item=, =free_item= - create and destroy menu items

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <menu.h>
    ITEM *new_item(const char *name, const char *description);
    int free_item(ITEM *item);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  The function =new_item= allocates a new item and initializes it from
  the =name= and =description= pointers.  Please notice that the item
  stores only the pointers to the name and description. Those pointers
  must be valid during the lifetime of the item. So you should be very
  careful with names or descriptions allocated on the stack of some
  routines.  The function =free_item= de-allocates an item. Please
  notice that it is the responsibility of the application to release
  the memory for the name or the description of the item.

* RETURN VALUE

  The function =new_item= returns =NULL= on error.  It sets =errno=
  according to the function's failure:

  - =E_BAD_ARGUMENT= :: Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range
                        argument.

  - =E_SYSTEM_ERROR= :: System error occurred, e.g., malloc failure.


  The function =free_item= returns one of the following:

  - =E_OK=           :: The routine succeeded.

  - =E_BAD_ARGUMENT= :: Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range
                        argument.

  - =E_CONNECTED=    :: Item is connected to a menu.

  - =E_SYSTEM_ERROR= :: System error occurred (see =errno=).

* NOTES

  The header file =<menu.h>= automatically includes the header file
  =<curses.h>=.

* PORTABILITY

  These routines emulate the System V menu library.  They were not
  supported on Version 7 or BSD versions.
