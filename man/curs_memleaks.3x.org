* NAME

  =_nc_freeall=, =_nc_free_and_exit= - =curses= memory-leak checking

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <curses.h>

    void _nc_freeall(void);
    void _nc_free_and_exit(int);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  These functions are used to simplify analysis of memory leaks in the
  ncurses library.  They are normally not available; they must be
  configured into the library at build time using the
  =--disable-leaks= option.  That compiles-in code that frees memory
  that normally would not be freed.

  Any implementation of curses must not free the memory associated
  with a screen, since (even after calling =endwin=), it must be
  available for use in the next call to =refresh=.  There are also
  chunks of memory held for performance reasons.  That makes it hard
  to analyze curses applications for memory leaks.  To work around
  this, one can build a debugging version of the ncurses library which
  frees those chunks which it can, and provides these functions to
  free all of the memory allocated by the ncurses library.

  The =_nc_free_and_exit= function is the preferred one since some of
  the memory which is freed may be required for the application to
  continue running.  Its parameter is the code to pass to the exit
  routine.

* RETURN VALUE

  These functions do not return a value.

* PORTABILITY

  These functions are not part of the XSI interface.
