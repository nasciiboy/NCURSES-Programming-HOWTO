* NAME

  =keyok= - enable or disable a keycode

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <curses.h>

    int keyok(int keycode, bool enable);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  This is an extension to the =curses= library.  It permits an
  application to disable specific keycodes, rather than use the
  =keypad= function to disable all keycodes.  Keys that have been
  disabled can be re-enabled.

* RETURN VALUE

  The keycode must be greater than zero, else =ERR= is returned.  If
  it does not correspond to a defined key, then =ERR= is returned.  If
  the /enable/ parameter is true, then the key must have been
  disabled, and vice versa.  Otherwise, the function returns =OK=.

* PORTABILITY

  These routines are specific to ncurses.  They were not supported on
  Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.  It is recommended that
  any code depending on them be conditioned using =NCURSES_VERSION=.
