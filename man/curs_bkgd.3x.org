* NAME

  =bkgdset=, =wbkgdset=, =bkgd=, =wbkgd=, =getbkgd= - =curses= window
  background manipulation routines

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <curses.h>

    void bkgdset(chtype ch);
    void wbkgdset(WINDOW *win, chtype ch);
    int bkgd(chtype ch);
    int wbkgd(WINDOW *win, chtype ch);
    chtype getbkgd(WINDOW *win);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

** bkgdset

   The =bkgdset= and =wbkgdset= routines manipulate the background of
   the named window.  The window background is a chtype consisting of
   any combination of attributes (i.e., rendition) and a character.
   The attribute part of the background is combined (OR'ed) with all
   non-blank characters that are written into the window with
   =waddch=.  Both the character and attribute parts of the background
   are combined with the blank characters.  The background becomes a
   property of the character and moves with the character through any
   scrolling and insert/delete line/character operations.

   To the extent possible on a particular terminal, the attribute part
   of the background is displayed as the graphic rendition of the
   character put on the screen.

** bkgd

   The =bkgd= and =wbkgd= functions set the background property of the
   current or specified window and then apply this setting to every
   character position in that window:

   * The rendition of every character on the screen is changed to the
     new background rendition.

   * Wherever the former background character appears, it is changed
     to the new background character.

** getbkgd

   The =getbkgd= function returns the given window's current
   background character/attribute pair.

* RETURN VALUE

  The routines =bkgd= and =wbkgd= return the integer =OK=.  The SVr4.0
  manual says "or a non-negative integer if =immedok= is set", but
  this appears to be an error.

* NOTES

  Note that =bkgdset= and =bkgd= may be macros.

* PORTABILITY

  These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.
  It specifies that =bkgd= and =wbkgd= return =ERR= on failure, but
  gives no failure conditions.
