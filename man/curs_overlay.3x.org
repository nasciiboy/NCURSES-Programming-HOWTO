* NAME

  =overlay=, =overwrite=, =copywin= - overlay and manipulate
  overlapped =curses= windows

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <curses.h>

    int overlay(const WINDOW *srcwin, WINDOW *dstwin);
    int overwrite(const WINDOW *srcwin, WINDOW *dstwin);
    int copywin(const WINDOW *srcwin, WINDOW *dstwin,  int sminrow,
                int smincol, int dminrow, int dmincol, int dmaxrow,
                int dmaxcol, int overlay);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

** =overlay=, =overwrite=

   The =overlay= and =overwrite= routines overlay srcwin on top of
   dstwin.  scrwin and dstwin are not required to be the same size;
   only text where the two windows overlap is copied.  The difference
   is that =overlay= is non-destructive (blanks are not copied)
   whereas =overwrite= is destructive.

** =copywin=

   The =copywin= routine provides a finer granularity of control over
   the =overlay= and =overwrite= routines.  As in the =prefresh=
   routine, a rectangle is specified in the destination window,
   (dminrow, dmincol) and (dmaxrow, dmaxcol), and the
   upper-left-corner coordinates of the source window, (sminrow,
   smincol).  If the argument =overlay= is true, then copying is
   non-destructive, as in =overlay=.

* RETURN VALUE

  Routines that return an integer return =ERR= upon failure, and =OK=
  (SVr4 only specifies "an integer value other than =ERR=") upon
  successful completion.

  X/Open defines no error conditions.  In this implementation,
  =copywin=, =overlay= and =overwrite= return an error if either of
  the window pointers are null, or if some part of the window would be
  placed off-screen.

* NOTES

  Note that =overlay= and =overwrite= may be macros.

* PORTABILITY

  The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions (adding
  the const qualifiers).  It further specifies their behavior in the
  presence of characters with multibyte renditions (not yet supported
  in this implementation).
