* NAME

  =set_menu_pattern=, =menu_pattern= - get and set a menu's pattern
  buffer

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <menu.h>
    int set_menu_pattern(MENU *menu, const char *pattern);
    char *menu_pattern(const MENU *menu);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  Every menu has an associated pattern match buffer.  As input events
  that are printable characters come in, they are appended to this
  match buffer and tested for a match, as described in
  [[file:menu_driver.3x.org][menu_driver(3x)]].

  The function =set_menu_pattern= sets the pattern buffer for the
  given menu and tries to find the first matching item.  If it
  succeeds, that item becomes current; if not, the current item does
  not change.

  The function =menu_pattern= returns the pattern buffer of the given
  /menu/.

* RETURN VALUE

  The function =menu_pattern= returns a pointer, which is =NULL= if
  the menu parameter is =NULL=.  Otherwise, it is a pointer to a
  string which is empty if no pattern has been set.  It does not set
  =errno=.

  The function =set_menu_pattern= may return the following error
  codes:

  - =E_OK=            :: The routine succeeded.

  - =E_BAD_ARGUMENT=  :: Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range
       argument.

  - =E_BAD_STATE=     :: Routine was called from an initialization or
                         termination function.

  - =E_NOT_CONNECTED= :: No items are connected to menu.

  - =E_NO_MATCH=      :: Character failed to match.

  - =E_SYSTEM_ERROR=  :: System error occurred (see =errno=).

* NOTES

  The header file =<menu.h>= automatically includes the header file
  =<curses.h>=.

* PORTABILITY

  These routines emulate the System V menu library.  They were not
  supported on Version 7 or BSD versions.
