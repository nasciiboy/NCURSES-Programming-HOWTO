* NAME

  =scr_dump=, =scr_restore=, =scr_init=, =scr_set= - read (write) a
  =curses= screen from (to) a file

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <curses.h>

    int scr_dump(const char *filename);
    int scr_restore(const char *filename);
    int scr_init(const char *filename);
    int scr_set(const char *filename);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  The =scr_dump= routine dumps the current contents of the virtual
  screen to the file /filename/.

  The =scr_restore= routine sets the virtual screen to the contents of
  /filename/, which must have been written using =scr_dump=. The next
  call to =doupdate= restores the screen to the way it looked in the
  dump file.

  The =scr_init= routine reads in the contents of /filename/ and uses
  them to initialize the =curses= data structures about what the
  terminal currently has on its screen.  If the data is determined to
  be valid, =curses= bases its next update of the screen on this
  information rather than clearing the screen and starting from
  scratch.  =scr_init= is used after =initscr= or a system call to
  share the screen with another process which has done a =scr_dump=
  after its =endwin= call.  The data is declared invalid if the
  terminfo capabilities =rmcup= and =nrrmc= exist; also if the
  terminal has been written to since the preceding =scr_dump= call.

  The =scr_set= routine is a combination of =scr_restore= and
  =scr_init=.  It tells the program that the information in /filename/
  is what is currently on the screen, and also what the program wants
  on the screen.  This can be thought of as a screen inheritance
  function.

  To read (write) a window from (to) a file, use the =getwin= and
  =putwin= routines [see [[file:curs_util.3x.org][curs_util(3x)]]].

* RETURN VALUE

  All routines return the integer =ERR= upon failure and =OK= upon
  success.

  X/Open defines no error conditions.  In this implementation, each
  will return an error if the file cannot be opened.

* NOTES

  Note that =scr_init=, =scr_set=, and =scr_restore= may be macros.

* PORTABILITY

  The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4, describes these functions (adding
  the const qualifiers).

  The SVr4 docs merely say under =scr_init= that the dump data is also
  considered invalid "if the time-stamp of the tty is old" but do not
  define "old".
