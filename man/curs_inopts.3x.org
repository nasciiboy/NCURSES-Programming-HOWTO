* DESCRIPTION

  The =ncurses= library provides several functions which let an
  application change the way input from the terminal is handled.  Some
  are global, applying to all windows.  Others apply only to a
  specific window.  Window-specific settings are not automatically
  applied to new or derived windows.  An application must apply these
  to each window, if the same behavior is needed.


** =cbreak=

   Normally, the tty driver buffers typed characters until a newline
   or carriage return is typed.  The =cbreak= routine disables line
   buffering and erase/kill character-processing (interrupt and flow
   control characters are unaffected), making characters typed by the
   user immediately available to the program.  The =nocbreak= routine
   returns the terminal to normal (cooked) mode.

   Initially the terminal may or may not be in =cbreak= mode, as the
   mode is inherited; therefore, a program should call =cbreak= or
   =nocbreak= explicitly.  Most interactive programs using =curses=
   set the =cbreak= mode.  Note that =cbreak= overrides =raw=.  [See
   [[file:curs_getch.3x.org][curs_getch(3x)]] for a discussion of how these routines interact with
   =echo= and =noecho=.]

** =echo=/=noecho=

   The =echo= and =noecho= routines control whether characters typed
   by the user are echoed by =getch= as they are typed.  Echoing by
   the tty driver is always disabled, but initially =getch= is in echo
   mode, so characters typed are echoed.  Authors of most interactive
   programs prefer to do their own echoing in a controlled area of the
   screen, or not to echo at all, so they disable echoing by calling
   =noecho=.  [See [[file:curs_getch.3x.org][curs_getch(3x)]] for a discussion of how these
   routines interact with =cbreak= and =nocbreak=.]

** =halfdelay=

   The =halfdelay= routine is used for half-delay mode, which is
   similar to =cbreak= mode in that characters typed by the user are
   immediately available to the program.  However, after blocking for
   /tenths/ tenths of seconds, =ERR= is returned if nothing has been
   typed.  The value of /tenths/ must be a number between 1 and 255.
   Use =nocbreak= to leave half-delay mode.

** =intrflush=

   If the =intrflush= option is enabled, (bf is =TRUE=), and an
   interrupt key is pressed on the keyboard (interrupt, break, quit)
   all output in the tty driver queue will be flushed, giving the
   effect of faster response to the interrupt, but causing =curses= to
   have the wrong idea of what is on the screen.  Disabling the option
   (bf is =FALSE=), the option prevents the flush.  The default for
   the option is inherited from the tty driver settings.  The window
   argument is ignored.

** =keypad=

   The =keypad= option enables the keypad of the user's terminal.  If
   enabled (bf is =TRUE=), the user can press a function key (such as
   an arrow key) and =wgetch= returns a single value representing the
   function key, as in =KEY_LEFT=.  If disabled (bf is =FALSE=),
   =curses= does not treat function keys specially and the program has
   to interpret the escape sequences itself.  If the =keypad= in the
   terminal can be turned on (made to transmit) and off (made to work
   locally), turning on this option causes the terminal keypad to be
   turned on when =wgetch= is called.  The default value for =keypad=
   is =FALSE=.

** =meta=

   Initially, whether the terminal returns 7 or 8 significant bits on
   input depends on the control mode of the tty driver [see
   [[man:termio][termio(7)]]].  To force 8 bits to be returned, invoke =meta(win,
   TRUE)=; this is equivalent, under POSIX, to setting the CS8 flag on
   the terminal.  To force 7 bits to be returned, invoke =meta(win,
   FALSE)=; this is equivalent, under POSIX, to setting the CS7 flag
   on the terminal.  The window argument, /win/, is always ignored.
   If the terminfo capabilities =smm= (meta_on) and =rmm= (meta_off)
   are defined for the terminal, =smm= is sent to the terminal when
   =meta(win, TRUE)= is called and =rmm= is sent when =meta(win,
   FALSE)= is called.

** =nodelay=

   The =nodelay= option causes =getch= to be a non-blocking call.  If
   no input is ready, =getch= returns =ERR=.  If disabled (/bf/ is
   =FALSE=), =getch= waits until a key is pressed.

   While interpreting an input escape sequence, =wgetch= sets a timer
   while waiting for the next character.  If =notimeout(win, TRUE)= is
   called, then =wgetch= does not set a timer.  The purpose of the
   timeout is to differentiate between sequences received from a
   function key and those typed by a user.

** =raw=/=noraw=

   The =raw= and =noraw= routines place the terminal into or out of
   raw mode.  Raw mode is similar to =cbreak= mode, in that characters
   typed are immediately passed through to the user program.  The
   differences are that in raw mode, the interrupt, quit, suspend, and
   flow control characters are all passed through uninterpreted,
   instead of generating a signal.  The behavior of the BREAK key
   depends on other bits in the tty driver that are not set by
   =curses=.

** =noqiflush=

   When the =noqiflush= routine is used, normal flush of input and
   output queues associated with the =INTR=, =QUIT= and =SUSP=
   characters will not be done [see [[man:termio][termio(7)]]].  When =qiflush= is
   called, the queues will be flushed when these control characters
   are read.  You may want to call =noqiflush()= in a signal handler
   if you want output to continue as though the interrupt had not
   occurred, after the handler exits.

** =timeout=/=wtimeout=

   The =timeout= and =wtimeout= routines set blocking or nonblocking
   read for a given window.  If delay is negative, blocking read is
   used (i.e., waits indefinitely for input).  If delay is zero, then
   non-blocking read is used (i.e., read returns =ERR= if no input is
   waiting).  If delay is positive, then read blocks for delay
   milliseconds, and returns =ERR= if there is still no input.  Hence,
   these routines provide the same functionality as =nodelay=, plus
   the additional capability of being able to block for only delay
   milliseconds (where delay is positive).

** =typeahead=

   The =curses= library does "line-breakout optimization" by looking
   for typeahead periodically while updating the screen.  If input is
   found, and it is coming from a tty, the current update is postponed
   until =refresh= or =doupdate= is called again.  This allows faster
   response to commands typed in advance.  Normally, the input FILE
   pointer passed to =newterm=, or =stdin= in the case that =initscr=
   was used, will be used to do this =typeahead= checking.  The
   typeahead routine specifies that the file descriptor fd is to be
   used to check for typeahead instead.  If fd is -1, then no
   typeahead checking is done.

* RETURN VALUE

  All routines that return an integer return =ERR= upon failure and
  =OK= (SVr4 specifies only "an integer value other than =ERR=") upon
  successful completion, unless otherwise noted in the preceding
  routine descriptions.

  X/Open does not define any error conditions.  In this
  implementation, functions with a window parameter will return an
  error if it is null.  Any function will also return an error if the
  terminal was not initialized.  Also,

  - =halfdelay= :: returns an error if its parameter is outside the
                   range 1..255.

* PORTABILITY

  These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.

  The =ncurses= library obeys the XPG4 standard and the historical
  practice of the AT&T =curses= implementations, in that the echo bit
  is cleared when =curses= initializes the terminal state.  BSD
  =curses= differed from this slightly; it left the echo bit on at
  initialization, but the BSD =raw= call turned it off as a
  side-effect.  For best portability, set echo or =noecho= explicitly
  just after initialization, even if your program remains in cooked
  mode.

  When =keypad= is first enabled, ncurses loads the key-definitions
  for the current terminal description.  If the terminal description
  includes extended string capabilities, e.g., from using the =-x=
  option of tic, then ncurses also defines keys for the capabilities
  whose names begin with "k".  The corresponding keycodes are
  generated and (depending on previous loads of terminal descriptions)
  may differ from one execution of a program to the next.  The
  generated keycodes are recognized by the =keyname= function (which
  will then return a name beginning with "k" denoting the terminfo
  capability name rather than "K", used for =curses= key-names).  On
  the other hand, an application can use =define_key= to establish a
  specific keycode for a given string.  This makes it possible for an
  application to check for an extended capability's presence with
  tigetstr, and reassign the keycode to match its own needs.

  Low-level applications can use =tigetstr= to obtain the definition
  of any particular string capability.  Higher-level applications
  which use the curses =wgetch= and similar functions to return
  keycodes rely upon the order in which the strings are loaded.  If
  more than one key definition has the same string value, then
  =wgetch= can return only one keycode.  Most =curses= implementations
  (including ncurses) load key definitions in the order defined by the
  array of string capability names.  The last key to be loaded
  determines the keycode which will be returned.  In ncurses, you may
  also have extended capabilities interpreted as key definitions.
  These are loaded after the predefined keys, and if a capability's
  value is the same as a previouslyloaded key definition, the later
  definition is the one used.

* NOTES

  Note that =echo=, =noecho=, =halfdelay=, =intrflush=, =meta=,
  =nodelay=, =notimeout=, =noqiflush=, =qiflush=, =timeout=, and
  =wtimeout= may be macros.

  The =noraw= and =nocbreak= calls follow historical practice in that
  they attempt to restore to normal (`cooked') mode from raw and
  =cbreak= modes respectively.  Mixing raw/noraw and =cbreak=/nocbreak
  calls leads to tty driver control states that are hard to predict or
  understand; it is not recommended.
