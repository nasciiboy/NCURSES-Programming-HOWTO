* NAME

  =menu_driver= - command-processing loop of the menu system

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <menu.h>
    int menu_driver(MENU *menu, int c);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  Once a menu has been posted (displayed), you should funnel input
  events to it through =menu_driver=.  This routine has three major
  input cases:

  * The input is a form navigation request.  Navigation request codes
    are constants defined in =<form.h>=, which are distinct from the
    key- and character codes returned by =wgetch=.

  * The input is a printable character.  Printable characters (which
    must be positive, less than 256) are checked according to the
    program's locale settings.

  * The input is the =KEY_MOUSE= special key associated with an mouse
    event.


  The menu driver requests are as follows:

  - =REQ_LEFT_ITEM=     :: Move left to an item.

  - =REQ_RIGHT_ITEM=    :: Move right to an item.

  - =REQ_UP_ITEM=       :: Move up to an item.

  - =REQ_DOWN_ITEM=     :: Move down to an item.

  - =REQ_SCR_ULINE=     :: Scroll up a line.

  - =REQ_SCR_DLINE=     :: Scroll down a line.

  - =REQ_SCR_DPAGE=     :: Scroll down a page.

  - =REQ_SCR_UPAGE=     :: Scroll up a page.

  - =REQ_FIRST_ITEM=    :: Move to the first item.

  - =REQ_LAST_ITEM=     :: Move to the last item.

  - =REQ_NEXT_ITEM=     :: Move to the next item.

  - =REQ_PREV_ITEM=     :: Move to the previous item.

  - =REQ_TOGGLE_ITEM=   :: Select/deselect an item.

  - =REQ_CLEAR_PATTERN= :: Clear the menu pattern buffer.

  - =REQ_BACK_PATTERN=  :: Delete the previous character from the
                           pattern buffer.

  - =REQ_NEXT_MATCH=    :: Move to the next item matching the pattern
                           match.

  - =REQ_PREV_MATCH=    :: Move to the previous item matching the
                           pattern match.


  If the second argument is a printable character, the code appends it
  to the pattern buffer and attempts to move to the next item matching
  the new pattern.  If there is no such match, =menu_driver= returns
  =E_NO_MATCH= and deletes the appended character from the buffer.

  If the second argument is one of the above pre-defined requests, the
  corresponding action is performed.

* MOUSE HANDLING

  If the second argument is the =KEY_MOUSE= special key, the
  associated mouse event is translated into one of the above
  pre-defined requests.  Currently only clicks in the user window
  (e.g., inside the menu display area or the decoration window) are
  handled.

  If you click above the display region of the menu:

  * a =REQ_SCR_ULINE= is generated for a single click,

  * a =REQ_SCR_UPAGE= is generated for a double-click and

  * a =REQ_FIRST_ITEM= is generated for a triple-click.


  If you click below the display region of the menu:

  * a =REQ_SCR_DLINE= is generated for a single click,

  * a =REQ_SCR_DPAGE= is generated for a double-click and

  * a =REQ_LAST_ITEM= is generated for a triple-click.


  If  you  click  at  an item inside the display area of the
  menu:

  * the menu cursor is positioned to that item.

  * If you double-click an item a =REQ_TOGGLE_ITEM= is generated and
    =E_UNKNOWN_COMMAND= is returned.  This return value makes sense,
    because a double click usually means that an item-specific action
    should be returned.  It is exactly the purpose of this return
    value to signal that an application specific command should be
    executed.

  * If a translation into a request was done, =menu_driver= returns
    the result of this request.


  If you clicked outside the user window or the mouse event could not
  be translated into a menu request an =E_REQUEST_DENIED= is returned.

* APPLICATION-DEFINED COMMANDS

  If the second argument is neither printable nor one of the above
  pre-defined menu requests or =KEY_MOUSE=, the drive assumes it is an
  application-specific command and returns =E_UNKNOWN_COMMAND=.
  Application-defined commands should be defined relative to
  =MAX_COMMAND=, the maximum value of these pre-defined requests.

* RETURN VALUE

  =menu_driver= return one of the following error codes:

  - =E_OK=              :: The routine succeeded.

  - =E_SYSTEM_ERROR=    :: System error occurred (see =errno=).

  - =E_BAD_ARGUMENT=    :: Routine detected an incorrect or
                           out-of-range argument.

  - =E_BAD_STATE=       :: Routine was called from an initialization
                           or termination function.

  - =E_NOT_POSTED=      :: The menu has not been posted.

  - =E_UNKNOWN_COMMAND= :: The menu driver code saw an unknown request
                           code.

  - =E_NO_MATCH=        :: Character failed to match.

  - =E_REQUEST_DENIED=  :: The menu driver could not process the
                           request.

* NOTES

  The header file =<menu.h>= automatically includes the header files
  =<curses.h>=.

* PORTABILITY

  These routines emulate the System V menu library.  They were not
  supported on Version 7 or BSD versions. The support for mouse events
  is ncurses specific.
