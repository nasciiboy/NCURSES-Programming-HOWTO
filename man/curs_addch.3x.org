* NAME

  =addch=, =waddch=, =mvaddch=, =mvwaddch=, =echochar=, =wechochar= -
  add a character (with attributes) to a curses window, then advance
  the cursor

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <curses.h>

    int addch(const chtype ch);
    int waddch(WINDOW *win, const chtype ch);
    int mvaddch(int y, int x, const chtype ch);
    int mvwaddch(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, const chtype ch);
    int echochar(const chtype ch);
    int wechochar(WINDOW *win, const chtype ch);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

** Adding characters

   The =addch=, =waddch=, =mvaddch= and =mvwaddch= routines put the
   character =ch= into the given window at its current window
   position, which is then advanced.  They are analogous to putchar in
   [[man:stdio][stdio(3)]].  If the advance is at the right margin:

   * The cursor automatically wraps to the beginning of the next line.

   * At the bottom of the current scrolling region, and if =scrollok=
     is enabled, the scrolling region is scrolled up one line.

   * If =scrollok= is not enabled, writing a character at the lower
     right margin succeeds.  However, an error is returned because it
     is not possible to wrap to a new line


   If =ch= is a tab, newline, carriage return or backspace, the cursor
   is moved appropriately within the window:

   * Backspace moves the cursor one character left; at the left edge
     of a window it does nothing.

   * Carriage return moves the cursor to the window left margin on the
     current line.

   * Newline does a =clrtoeol=, then moves the cursor to the window
     left margin on the next line, scrolling the window if on the last
     line.

   * Tabs are considered to be at every eighth column.  The tab
     interval may be altered by setting the =TABSIZE= variable.


   If =ch= is any other control character, it is drawn in ^X notation.
   Calling winch after adding a control character does not return the
   character itself, but instead returns the =^=-representation of the
   control character.

   Video attributes can be combined with a character argument passed
   to =addch= or related functions by logical-ORing them into the
   character.  (Thus, text, including attributes, can be copied from
   one place to another using inch and =addch=.) See the [[file:curs_attr.3x.org][curs_attr(3x)]]
   page for values of predefined video attribute constants that can be
   usefully OR'ed into characters.

** Echoing characters

   The =echochar= and =wechochar= routines are equivalent to a call to
   =addch= followed by a call to refresh, or a call to =waddch=
   followed by a call to wrefresh.  The knowledge that only a single
   character is being output is used and, for non-control characters,
   a considerable performance gain may be seen by using these routines
   instead of their equivalents.

** Line Graphics

   The following variables may be used to add line drawing characters
   to the screen with routines of the =addch= family.  The default
   character listed below is used if the acsc capability does not
   define a terminal-specific replacement for it, or if the terminal
   and locale configuration requires Unicode but the library is unable
   to use Unicode.

   The names are taken from VT100 nomenclature.

* RETURN VALUE

  All routines return the integer =ERR= upon failure and =OK= on
  success (the SVr4 manuals specify only "an integer value other than
  =ERR=") upon successful completion, unless otherwise noted in the
  preceding routine descriptions.

  Functions with a "mv" prefix first perform a cursor movement using
  =wmove=, and return an error if the position is outside the window,
  or if the window pointer is null.

* NOTES

  Note that =addch=, =mvaddch=, =mvwaddch=, and =echochar= may be
  macros.

* PORTABILITY

  All these functions are described in the XSI Curses standard,
  Issue 4.  The defaults specified for forms-drawing characters apply
  in the POSIX locale.

  X/Open Curses states that the =ACS_= definitions are char constants.
  For the wide-character implementation (see curs_add_wch), there are
  analogous =WACS_= definitions which are =cchar_t= constants.

  Some ACS symbols (=ACS_S3=, =ACS_S7=, =ACS_LEQUAL=, =ACS_GEQUAL=,
  =ACS_PI=, =ACS_NEQUAL=, =ACS_STERLING=) were not documented in any
  publicly released System V.  However, many publicly available
  terminfos include acsc strings in which their key characters
  (pryz{|}) are embedded, and a second-hand list of their character
  descriptions has come to light.  The ACS-prefixed names for them
  were invented for [[file:ncurses.3x.org][ncurses(3x)]].

  The /displayed/ values for the =ACS_= and =WACS_= constants depend
  on

  * the library configuration, i.e., =ncurses= versus ncursesw, where
    the latter is capable of displaying Unicode while the former is
    not, and

  * whether the locale uses UTF-8 encoding.


  In certain cases, the terminal is unable to display linedrawing
  characters except by using UTF-8 (see the discussion of
  =NCURSES_NO_UTF8_ACS= in [[file:ncurses.3x.org][ncurses(3x)]]).

  The =TABSIZE= variable is implemented in some versions of curses, but
  is not part of X/Open curses.

  If =ch= is a carriage return, the cursor is moved to the beginning
  of the current row of the window.  This is true of other
  implementations, but is not documented.
