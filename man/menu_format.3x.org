* NAME

  =set_menu_format=, =menu_format= - set and get menu sizes

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <menu.h>
    int set_menu_format(MENU *menu, int rows, int cols);
    void menu_format(const MENU *menu, int *rows, int *cols);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  The function =set_menu_format= sets the maximum display size of the
  given menu.  If this size is too small to display all menu items,
  the menu will be made scrollable. If this size is larger than the
  menus subwindow and the subwindow is too small to display all menu
  items, =post_menu()= will fail.

  The default format is 16 rows, 1 column.  Calling =set_menu_format=
  with a null menu pointer will change this default.  A zero row or
  column argument to =set_menu_format= is interpreted as a request not
  to change the current value.

  The function =menu_format= returns the maximum-size constraints for
  the given menu into the storage addressed by =rows= and =cols=.

* RETURN VALUE

  These routines returns one of the following:

  - =E_OK=            :: The routine succeeded.

  - =E_SYSTEM_ERROR=  :: System error occurred (see =errno=).

  - =E_BAD_ARGUMENT=  :: Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range
                         argument.

  - =E_POSTED=        :: The menu is already posted.

  - =E_NOT_CONNECTED= :: No items are connected to the menu.

* NOTES

  The header file =<menu.h>= automatically includes the header file
  =<curses.h>=.

* PORTABILITY

  These routines emulate the System V menu library.  They were not
  supported on Version 7 or BSD versions.
