* NAME

  =erase=, =werase=, =clear=, =wclear=, =clrtobot=, =wclrtobot=,
  =clrtoeol=, =wclrtoeol= - clear all or part of a =curses= window

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    include <curses.h>

    int erase(void);
    int werase(WINDOW *win);
    int clear(void);
    int wclear(WINDOW *win);
    int clrtobot(void);
    int wclrtobot(WINDOW *win);
    int clrtoeol(void);
    int wclrtoeol(WINDOW *win);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  The =erase= and =werase= routines copy blanks to every position in
  the window, clearing the screen.

  The =clear= and =wclear= routines are like =erase= and =werase=, but
  they also call =clearok=, so that the screen is cleared completely
  on the next call to =wrefresh= for that window and repainted from
  scratch.

  The =clrtobot= and =wclrtobot= routines erase from the cursor to the
  end of screen.  That is, they erase all lines below the cursor in
  the window.  Also, the current line to the right of the cursor,
  inclusive, is erased.

  The =clrtoeol= and =wclrtoeol= routines erase the current line to
  the right of the cursor, inclusive, to the end of the current line.

  Blanks created by erasure have the current background rendition (as
  set by =wbkgdset=) merged into them.

* RETURN VALUE

  All routines return the integer =OK= on success and =ERR= on
  failure.  The SVr4.0 manual says "or a non-negative integer if
  =immedok= is set", but this appears to be an error.

  X/Open defines no error conditions.  In this implementation,
  functions using a window pointer parameter return an error if it is
  null.

* NOTES

  Note that =erase=, =werase=, =clear=, =wclear=, =clrtobot=, and
  =clrtoeol= may be macros.

* PORTABILITY

  These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.
  The standard specifies that they return =ERR= on failure, but
  specifies no error conditions.

  Some historic =curses= implementations had, as an undocumented
  feature, the ability to do the equivalent of =clearok(..., 1)= by
  saying =touchwin(stdscr)= or =clear(stdscr)=.  This will not work
  under ncurses.

  This implementation, and others such as Solaris, sets the current
  position to 0,0 after erasing via =werase()= and =wclear()=.  That
  fact is not documented in other implementations, and may not be true
  of implementations which were not derived from SVr4 source.

  Not obvious from the description, most implementations clear the
  screen after =wclear= even for a subwindow or derived window.  If
  you do not want to clear the screen during the next =wrefresh=, use
  =werase= instead.
