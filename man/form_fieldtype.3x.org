* DESCRIPTION

  The function =new_fieldtype= creates a new field type usable for
  data validation.  You supply it with field_check, a predicate to
  check the validity of an entered data string whenever the user
  attempts to leave a field.  The (=FIELD *=) argument is passed in so
  the validation predicate can see the field's buffer, sizes and other
  attributes; the second argument is an argument-block structure,
  about which more below.

  You also supply =new_fieldtype= with =char_check=, a function to
  validate input characters as they are entered; it will be passed the
  character to be checked and a pointer to an argument-block
  structure.

  The function =free_fieldtype= frees the space allocated for a given
  validation type.

  The function =set_fieldtype_arg= associates three storagemanagement
  functions with a field type.  The =make_arg= function is
  automatically applied to the list of arguments you give
  =set_field_type= when attaching validation to a field; its job is to
  bundle these into an allocated argument-block object which can later
  be passed to validation predicated.  The other two hook arguments
  should copy and free argument-block structures.  They will be used
  by the forms-driver code.  You must supply the make_arg function,
  the other two are optional, you may supply =NULL= for them.  In this
  case it is assumed that make_arg does not allocate memory but simply
  loads the argument into a single scalar value.

  The function =link_fieldtype= creates a new field type from the two
  given types.  They are connected by an logical 'OR'.

  The form driver requests =REQ_NEXT_CHOICE= and =REQ_PREV_CHOICE=
  assume that the possible values of a field form an ordered set, and
  provide the forms user with a way to move through the set.  The
  =set_fieldtype_choice= function allows forms programmers to define
  successor and predecessor functions for the field type.  These
  functions take the field pointer and an argument-block structure as
  arguments.

* RETURN VALUE

  The pointer-valued routines return =NULL= on error.  They set
  =errno= according to their success:

  * =E_OK=           :: The routine succeeded.

  * =E_BAD_ARGUMENT= :: Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range
                        argument.

  * =E_SYSTEM_ERROR= :: System error occurred, e.g., malloc failure.

  The integer-valued routines return one of the following codes on
  error:

  * =E_OK=           :: The routine succeeded.

  * =E_BAD_ARGUMENT= :: Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range
                        argument.

  * =E_CONNECTED=    :: The field is already connected to a form.

  * =E_CURRENT=      :: The field is the current field.

  * =E_SYSTEM_ERROR= :: System error occurred (see =errno=).

* NOTES

  The header file =<form.h>= automatically includes the header file
  =<curses.h>=.

  All of the (=char *=) arguments of these functions should actually
  be (=void *=).  The type has been left uncorrected for strict
  compatibility with System V.

* PORTABILITY

  These routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not
  supported on Version 7 or BSD versions.
