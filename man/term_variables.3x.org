* DESCRIPTION

  This page summarizes variables provided by the =curses= library's
  low-level terminfo interface.  A more complete description is given
  in the [[file:curs_terminfo.3x.org][curs_terminfo(3x)]] manual page.

  Depending on the configuration, these may be actual variables, or
  macros (see [[file:curs_threads.3x.org][curs_threads(3x)]]) which provide read-only access to
  =curses='s state.  In either case, applications should treat them as
  read-only to avoid confusing the library.

** Alternate Character Set Mapping

   After initializing the curses or terminfo interfaces, the =acs_map=
   array holds information used to translate cells with the
   =A_ALTCHARSET= video attribute into line-drawing characters.

   The encoding of the information in this array has changed
   periodically.  Application developers need only know that it is
   used for the "ACS_" constants in =<curses.h>=.

   The comparable data for the wide-character library is a private
   variable.

** Current Terminal Data

   After initializing the curses or terminfo interfaces, the
   =cur_term= contains data describing the current terminal.  This
   variable is also set as a side-effect of [[file:curs_initscr.3x.org][curs_initscr(3x)]] and
   [[file:curs_initscr.3x.org][curs_initscr(3x)]].

   It is possible to save a value of =cur_term= for subsequent use as
   a parameter to =set_term=, for switching between screens.
   Alternatively, one can save the return value from =newterm= or
   =setupterm= to reuse in =set_term=.

** Terminfo Names

   The [[file:tic.1m.org][tic(1m)]] and [[file:infocmp.1m.org][infocmp(1m)]] programs use lookup tables for the long
   and short names of terminfo capabilities, as well as the
   corresponding names for termcap capabilities.  These are available
   to other applications, although the hash-tables used by the
   terminfo and termcap functions are not available.

   The long terminfo capability names use a "l" (ell) in their names:
   =boolfnames=, =numfnames=, and =strfnames=.

   These are the short names for terminfo capabilities: =boolnames=,
   =numnames=, and =strnames=.

   These are the corresponding names used for termcap descriptions:
   =boolcodes=, =numcodes=, and =strcodes=.

** Terminal Type

   On initialization of the curses or terminfo interfaces, =setupterm=
   copies the terminal name to the array =ttytype=.

** Terminfo Names

   In addition to the variables, =<term.h>= also defines a symbol for
   each terminfo capability long name.  These are in terms of the
   symbol =CUR=, which is defined

   #+BEGIN_SRC c
     #define CUR cur_term->type.
   #+END_SRC

   These symbols provide a faster method of accessing terminfo
   capabilities than using [[file:curs_terminfo.3x.org][tigetstr(3x)]], etc.

* NOTES

  The low-level terminfo interface is initialized using
  [[file:curs_terminfo.3x.org][curs_terminfo(3x)]].  The upper-level curses interface uses the
  low-level terminfo interface, internally.

* PORTABILITY

  X/Open Curses does not describe any of these except for =cur_term=.
  (The inclusion of =cur_term= appears to be an oversight, since other
  comparable low-level information is omitted by X/Open).

  Other implementations may have comparable variables.  Some
  implementations provide the variables in their libraries, but omit
  them from the header files.

  All implementations which provide terminfo interfaces add
  definitions as described in the *Terminfo Names* section.  Most, but
  not all, base the definition upon the =cur_term= variable.
