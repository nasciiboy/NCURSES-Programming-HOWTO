* NAME

  =post_form=, =unpost_form= - write or erase forms from associated
  subwindows

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <form.h>
    int post_form(FORM *form);
    int unpost_form(FORM *form);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  The function =post_form= displays a form to its associated
  subwindow.  To trigger physical display of the subwindow, use
  =refresh= or some equivalent =curses= routine (the implicit
  =doupdate= triggered by an =curses= input request will do).

  The function =unpost_form= erases form from its associated
  subwindow.

* RETURN VALUE

  These routines return one of the following:

  - =E_OK=            :: The routine succeeded.

  - =E_BAD_ARGUMENT=  :: Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range
                         argument.

  - =E_BAD_STATE=     :: Routine was called from an initialization or
                         termination function.

  - =E_NOT_POSTED=    :: The form has not been posted.

  - =E_NOT_CONNECTED= :: No items are connected to the form.

  - =E_NO_ROOM=       :: Form is too large for its window.

  - =E_POSTED=        :: The form has already been posted.

  - =E_SYSTEM_ERROR=  :: System error occurred (see =errno=).

* NOTES

  =<curses.h>=.

* PORTABILITY

  These routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not
  supported on Version 7 or BSD versions.
