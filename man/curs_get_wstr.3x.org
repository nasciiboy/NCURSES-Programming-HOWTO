  =get_wstr=, =getn_wstr=, =wget_wstr=, =wgetn_wstr=, =mvget_wstr=,
  =mvgetn_wstr=, =mvwget_wstr=, =mvwgetn_wstr= - get an array of wide
  characters from a =curses= terminal keyboard

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <curses.h>

    int get_wstr(wint_t *wstr);
    int getn_wstr(wint_t *wstr, int n);
    int wget_wstr(WINDOW *win, wint_t *wstr);
    int wgetn_wstr(WINDOW *win, wint_t *wstr, int n);
    int mvget_wstr(int y, int x, wint_t *wstr);
    int mvgetn_wstr(int y, int x, wint_t *wstr, int n);
    int mvwget_wstr(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, wint_t *wstr);
    int mvwgetn_wstr(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, wint_t *wstr, int n);

* DESCRIPTION

  The effect of =get_wstr= is as though a series of calls to =get_wch=
  were made, until a newline, other end-of-line, or end-of-file
  condition is processed.  An end-of-file condition is represented by
  =WEOF=, as defined in =<wchar.h>=.  The newline and end-of-line
  conditions are represented by the =\n= =wchar_t= value.  In all
  instances, the end of the string is terminated by a null =wchar_t=.
  The routine places resulting values in the area pointed to by
  /wstr/.

  The user's =erase= and kill characters are interpreted.  If =keypad=
  mode is on for the window, =KEY_LEFT= and =KEY_BACKSPACE= are both
  considered equivalent to the user's kill character.

  Characters input are echoed only if =echo= is currently on.  In that
  case, backspace is echoed as deletion of the previous character
  (typically a left motion).

  The effect of =wget_wstr= is as though a series of calls to
  =wget_wch= were made.

  The effect of =mvget_wstr= is as though a call to  move  and
  then a series of calls to =get_wch= were made.

  The effect of =mvwget_wstr= is as though a call to =wmove= and then
  a series of calls to =wget_wch= were made.

  The =getn_wstr=, =mvgetn_wstr=, =mvwgetn_wstr=, and =wgetn_wstr=
  functions are identical to the =get_wstr=, =mvget_wstr=,
  =mvwget_wstr=, and =wget_wstr= functions, respectively, except that
  the *n_* versions read at most /n/ characters, letting the
  application prevent overflow of the input buffer.

* NOTES

  Using =get_wstr=, =mvget_wstr=, =mvwget_wstr=, or =wget_wstr= to
  read a line that overflows the array pointed to by /wstr/ causes
  undefined results.  The use of =getn_wstr=, =mvgetn_wstr=,
  =mvwgetn_wstr=, or =wgetn_wstr=, respectively, is recommended.

  These functions cannot return =KEY_= values because there is no way
  to distinguish a =KEY_= value from a valid =wchar_t= value.

  All of these routines except =wgetn_wstr= may be macros.

* RETURN VALUE

  All of these functions return =OK= upon successful completion.
  Otherwise, they return =ERR=.

  Functions using a window parameter return an error if it is null.

  - =wgetn_wstr= :: returns an error if the associated call to
                    wget_wch failed.


  Functions with a "mv" prefix first perform a cursor movement using
  =wmove=, and return an error if the position is outside the window,
  or if the window pointer is null.

* PORTABILITY

  These functions are described in The Single Unix Specification,
  Version 2.  No error conditions are defined.  This implementation
  returns =ERR= if the window pointer is null, or if the lower-level
  =wget_wch= call returns an =ERR=.  In the latter case, an =ERR=
  return without other data is treated as an end-of-file condition,
  and the returned array contains a =WEOF= followed by a null
  =wchar_t=.

  X/Open =curses= documents these functions to pass an array of
  =wchar_t=, but all of the vendors implement this using =wint_t=.
