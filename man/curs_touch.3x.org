* NAME

  =touchwin=, =touchline=, =untouchwin=, =wtouchln=, =is_linetouched=,
  =is_wintouched= - =curses= refresh control routines

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <curses.h>
    int touchwin(WINDOW *win);
    int touchline(WINDOW *win, int start, int count);
    int untouchwin(WINDOW *win);
    int wtouchln(WINDOW *win, int y, int n, int changed);
    bool is_linetouched(WINDOW *win, int line);
    bool is_wintouched(WINDOW *win);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  The =touchwin= and =touchline= routines throw away all optimization
  information about which parts of the window have been touched, by
  pretending that the entire window has been drawn on.  This is
  sometimes necessary when using overlapping windows, since a change
  to one window affects the other window, but the records of which
  lines have been changed in the other window do not reflect the
  change.  The routine =touchline= only pretends that /count/ lines
  have been changed, beginning with line start.

  The =untouchwin= routine marks all lines in the window as unchanged
  since the last call to =wrefresh=.

  The =wtouchln= routine makes /n/ lines in the window, starting at
  line /y/, look as if they have (changed=1) or have not (changed=0)
  been changed since the last call to =wrefresh=.

  The =is_linetouched= and =is_wintouched= routines return =TRUE= if
  the specified line/window was modified since the last call to
  =wrefresh=; otherwise they return =FALSE=.  In addition,
  =is_linetouched= returns =ERR= if /line/ is not valid for the given
  window.

* RETURN VALUE

  All routines return the integer =ERR= upon failure and an integer
  value other than =ERR= upon successful completion, unless otherwise
  noted in the preceding routine descriptions.

  X/Open does not define any error conditions.  In this implementation

  - =is_linetouched= ::

    returns an error if the window pointer is null, or if the line
    number is outside the window.  Note that =ERR= is distinct from
    =TRUE= and =FALSE=, which are the normal return values of this
    function.

  - =wtouchln= ::

    returns an error if the window pointer is null, or if the line
    number is outside the window.

* PORTABILITY

  The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions.

  Some historic =curses= implementations had, as an undocumented
  feature, the ability to do the equivalent of =clearok(..., 1)= by
  saying =touchwin(stdscr)= or =clear(stdscr)=.  This will not work
  under ncurses.

* NOTES

  Note that all routines except =wtouchln= may be macros.
