* NAME

  =ins_wstr=, =ins_nwstr=, =wins_wstr=, =wins_nwstr=, =mvins_wstr=,
  =mvins_nwstr=, =mvwins_wstr=, =mvwins_nwstr= - insert a
  widecharacter string into a =curses= window

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <curses.h>

    int ins_wstr(const wchar_t *wstr);
    int ins_nwstr(const wchar_t *wstr, int n);
    int wins_wstr(WINDOW *win, const wchar_t *wstr);
    int wins_nwstr(WINDOW *win, const wchar_t *wstr, int n);
    int mvins_wstr(int y, int x, const wchar_t *wstr);
    int mvins_nwstr(int y, int x, const wchar_t *wstr, int n);
    int mvwins_wstr(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, const wchar_t *wstr);
    int mvwins_nwstr(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, const wchar_t *wstr, int n);

* DESCRIPTION

  These routines insert a =wchar_t= character string (as many
  characters as will fit on the line) before the character under the
  cursor.  All characters to the right of the cursor are shifted
  right, with the possibility of the rightmost characters on the line
  being lost.  No wrapping is performed.  The cursor position does not
  change (after moving to /y/, /x/, if specified).  The four routines
  with n as the last argument insert a leading substring of at most
  /n/ =wchar_t= characters.  If /n/ is less than 1, the entire string
  is inserted.

  If a character in /wstr/ is a tab, newline, carriage return or
  backspace, the cursor is moved appropriately within the window.  A
  newline also does a =clrtoeol= before moving.  Tabs are considered
  to be at every eighth column.  If a character in /wstr/ is another
  control character, it is drawn in the ^X notation.  Calling
  =win_wch= after adding a control character (and moving to it, if
  necessary) does not return the control character, but instead
  returns a character in the =^=-representation of the control
  character.

* NOTES

  Note that all but wins_nwstr may be macros.

  If the first character in the string is a nonspacing character,
  these functions will fail.  XSI does not define what will happen if
  a nonspacing character follows a control character.

* RETURN VALUE

  Upon successful completion, these functions return =OK=.  Otherwise,
  they return =ERR=.

  Functions with a "mv" prefix first perform a cursor movement using
  =wmove=, and return an error if the position is outside the window,
  or if the window pointer is null.
